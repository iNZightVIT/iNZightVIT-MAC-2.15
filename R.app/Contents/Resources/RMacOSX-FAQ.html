<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document contains a user guide to the <span class="sc">R.app</span> version of <acronym>R</acronym>, and
information on using <acronym>R</acronym> on OS X which supplements the main <acronym>R</acronym>
manuals.

   <p>In this document <acronym>R</acronym> refers to the core, command-line-based <acronym>R</acronym> system
while <span class="sc">R.app</span> refers to the GUI-based Mac OS application that controls
the underlying <acronym>R</acronym>.

   <p>This `R for Mac OS X FAQ' is rather incomplete at the moment and requires
contributions from users.  Anything specific to the R language can be
found in the main R-FAQ (see
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html</a>).  Please send any
requests/questions you would like answers to the
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mac">R-SIG-Mac</a>
mailing list (after subscribing) as well as comments on this FAQ.

   <p>The last section of this document contains the most frequently asked
questions that don't fit strictly into any of the categories above &ndash; it
is usually a good idea to always look into that section if your issue
doesn't fit any of the above or was not answered in one of the specific
sections. <em>Always read this FAQ before asking for help on

<h3 class="section">1.1 How many versions of R for Mac OS X?</h3>

<p>There is only one version of R for Mac OS X.  However, <acronym>R</acronym> on Mac OS X
can be used either on the command-line (see <a href="#Command-line-version-of-R">Command line version of R</a>) like on other Unix systems, or via the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI (see <a href="#R_002eapp">R.app</a>). 
The second approach is mostly preferred by Macintosh users.  There are
separate 32- and 64-bit versions of <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

<h3 class="section">1.2 What machines does R for Mac OS X run on?</h3>

<p>The binaries provided on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> are multi-architecture (currently
32-bit Intel + 64-bit Intel) and require Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or
higher.

   <p>Support for Leopard and 32-bit builds will be dropped in the next <acronym>R</acronym>
series (starting with 3.0.0 in April 2013).

   <p><acronym>R</acronym> can in principle be built from the sources on earlier versions of
OS X, and also for PowerPC and PowerPC64 on Leopard: but this has not be
tested recently.  (PowerPC binaries were last supplied for <acronym>R</acronym> 2.15.0.)

<h3 class="section">1.3 How can R for Mac OS X be obtained and installed?</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> is available on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> in the form of an Installer package
containing the R framework and the 32- and 64-bit versions of the
<span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI. The package is usually named <samp><span class="file">R.pkg</span></samp> with an optional
version number.

   <p>The installation is done by double-clicking on the Installer
package. The Installer will guide you through the necessary steps.  Note
that it will require password or login of an account with administrator
privileges.  The installation can be customized, but the default is
suitable for most users.

   <p>Snapshots of the R-patched and R-devel flavours are available at
<a href="http://r.research.att.com/">http://r.research.att.com/</a>, packaged in the same way.

<h3 class="section">1.4 How can R for Mac OS X be uninstalled?</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> for Mac OS X consists of two parts: the GUI (<span class="sc">R.app</span>) and the R
framework. The un-installation is as simple as removing those folders
(e.g. by dragging them into the Trash). The typical installation will
install the GUI into the <samp><span class="file">/Applications</span></samp> folder and the R framework
in the <samp><span class="file">/Library/Frameworks</span></samp> folder.

   <p>If you want to get rid of R using a Terminal, simply run (prepend
<code>sudo</code> if needed):

<pre class="example">     rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework /Applications/R.app /Applications/R64.app
     rm -f /usr/bin/R /usr/bin/Rscript /usr/bin/R32 /usr/bin/R64
</pre>
   <p>An alternative is to use Apple's <code>pkgutil</code> tools to uninstall
R. The installation consists of three packages:
<code>org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg</code>,
<code>org.r-project.R.Leopard.GUI.pkg</code> and
<code>org.r-project.R.Leopard.GUI64.pkg</code>. You can use <code>pkgutil
--unlink</code> (not supported on Lion and later) for each of them to remove
their files and/or <code>pkgutil --forget</code> if you want the Apple
Installer to forget about the package without deleting its files (useful
when installing multiple R versions in parallel), or after you have
deleted the files.

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.5 Installation Problems</h3>

<p>On Mountain Lion some of the packages may need (depending on your
security settings) to be installed by right/control-clicking, selecting
`<samp><span class="samp">Open</span></samp>' and then clicking `<samp><span class="samp">Open</span></samp>' in the resulting dialog box.

   <p>The binary version of <acronym>R</acronym> is provided as an Apple Installer package. If
you encounter any problem during the installation, please check the
Installer log by clicking on the &ldquo;Window&rdquo; menu and item &ldquo;Installer
Log&rdquo;. The full output (select &ldquo;Show All Log&rdquo;) is useful for tracking
down problems.

   <p><strong>Note:</strong> In order for Tcl/Tk to work, don't forget to install the
additional tools from
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/">http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/</a>.  These are updated
rarely, so only need to be installed the first time you install <acronym>R</acronym>. 
The disk image contains a package <samp><span class="file">tcltk.pkg</span></samp>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Building R from sources</h2>

<p>This information is now in the `R Installation and Administration
Manual' which ships with each version of <acronym>R</acronym>: the latest versions can
be found at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html">http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html</a>.  It includes
information on how to build <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Command line version of R</h2>

<p>The command line version of <acronym>R</acronym> is almost identical to <acronym>R</acronym> as used on
other Unix-like operating systems. Therefore general documentation for
<acronym>R</acronym> applies to this version as well.  On each release ready-to-use
binaries are distributed through <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  These binaries come with a
common installer used by <span class="sc">R.app</span> so please read the related notes
(see <a href="#How-to-get-R_002eapp">How to get R.app</a>).

   <p>On recent versions of OS X (Snow Leopard and later) the installer links
three executables in <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin</span></samp>, <code>R32</code>, <code>R64</code> and
<code>R</code>.  The first is 32-bit, the second is 64-bit and <code>R</code> is
64-bit on Snow Leopard and Lion and later but 32-bit on Leopard (and on
Mountain Lion for 2.15.2 and earlier).  It also links <code>Rscript</code> (of
the same default architecture as <code>R</code>).

   <p>One thing that is different from <acronym>R</acronym> on any other Unix-like is the way
output is displayed on a terminal.  Except for `dumb' terminals,
messages to <samp><span class="file">stderr</span></samp> are diverted to <samp><span class="file">stdout</span></samp> and displayed in
bold using ANSI terminal escapes.

<!-- links to /usr/bin/R these days. -->
<!-- To use @R{} you probably need to add a symbolic link on your system as -->
<!-- the @R{} binary is located inside the framework.  Suppose you have the -->
<!-- @emph{/usr/local/bin} directory on your system (if you do not have one, -->
<!-- you can use @emph{/usr/bin} instead) you should just type in your -->
<!-- Terminal (a root password is required) -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/R /usr/local/bin/R -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- Assuming that you have @emph{/usr/local/bin} in your @emph{PATH} -->
<!-- environment variable, you will be able to launch R from any location on -->
<!-- your system just by typing @emph{R}. In this way, when you install a new -->
<!-- version of the @emph{R.framework} this link will point to the latest R -->
<!-- binary. -->

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> is the name of the GUI for Mac OS X that was introduced in R
2.0.0. It appears as an icon labeled <em>R</em> or <em>R64</em>, but to
avoid confusion with general <acronym>R</acronym>, we prefer to use the name as it
appears when using <em>Get Info</em> on the GUI: <span class="sc">R.app</span> This stands for
<em>R application</em>.

   <p>Internally <span class="sc">R.app</span> is a Cocoa program (hence written in Objective C)
which links to embedded <acronym>R</acronym> installed as a framework.

<!-- Historically there were two more GUIs for Mac OS X: @emph{RAqua} and @emph{Cocoa GUI bundle}. The latter was never officially released and RAqua was retired in R version 2.1, because it used legacy toolkit from the times of MacOS9. -->

<h3 class="section">4.1 How to get R.app</h3>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> is part of the binary distribution of R for Mac OS X available
from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. That distribution consists of one package containing the R
framework and 32- and 64-bit versions of <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

   <p>Development versions of <span class="sc">R.app</span> are made available on daily basis in the
form of a disk image containing the <span class="sc">R.app</span> itself. See the Mac OS X
pages on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> for detail how to obtain such snapshots (currently at

<acronym>CRAN</acronym> site contains a standard Apple installer package named
<samp><span class="file">R.pkg</span></samp> (optionally containing the version number). Download and
double-click the package icon.

   <p>Please, carefully read the note on the usage of tcltk and Fortran on the <samp><span class="file">bin/macosx</span></samp> directory of a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> site.

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 The Input and the Output</h4>

<p>The current design of the R Console is to have a single frame for input (user) and output (R).

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 Copy and Paste</h4>

<p>Copy and paste works in R as in any other Macintosh application.

   <p>If you want high resolution graphic exports, you can save the PDF format using the <em>File/Save as</em> menu item (see <a href="#Quartz-device">Quartz device</a>). Or you can use supported formats in R through <code>pdf()</code>, <code>jpeg()</code> etc. (type <code>?capabilities</code> to get more details).

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.3 The current and startup working directories</h4>

<p>If not otherwise specified in the Preferences (see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a>), or if the specified path is no longer available, then the default working directory at startup is the user home. 
The working directory can be changed using the <em>setwd</em> R command or using the <em>Misc</em> menu item <em>Change working directory</em>. Finally it is possible to use a specific directory for a single <acronym>R</acronym> session by dragging a folder onto the <span class="sc">R.app</span> icon. If <span class="sc">R.app</span> is not running, this will cause <span class="sc">R.app</span> to be started in the directory corresponding to the folder dragged. The same can be achieved on the command line &ndash; for example <code>open -a R .</code> causes <span class="sc">R.app</span> to be started using the current directory as the startup working directory.

<p class="noindent">This feature is useful if you want different startup procedures defined by the <samp><span class="file">.Rprofile</span></samp>; you can
edit a <samp><span class="file">.Rprofile</span></samp> (containing you personal initialization <acronym>R</acronym> commands) in a particular directory and use
the Preferences (or any other method mentioned above) to change the startup directory. Next time you launch <samp><span class="file">R.app</span></samp> the <samp><span class="file">.Rprofile</span></samp> is read and executed by <acronym>R</acronym> at startup. This is the equivalent on Unix (or the command line) to launch <acronym>R</acronym> from different directories.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Editor</h4>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> provides an integrated editor for editing of R code. It sports a number of features designed to help developing code inside R. The probably most often used function is the ability to execute code directly from the editor by pressing <kbd>&lt;Command&gt;-&lt;Return&gt;</kbd>. Other features include syntax highlighting, brace-matching, code completion and function indexing.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 Editor undo and line numbers</h4>

<p>The editor supports undo/redo operations on an appropriate level of granularity (used to
be all or nothing). The editor has an optional facility to show line numbers. These help with
locating error messages. The editor also responds to the 'Go to Line' Edit menu function. The
associated Preference Pane allows enabling/disabling of the line numbers, as well as setting line
number gutter width (to fit larger line numbers) and text margin width.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.3 Editor text completion</h4>

<p>Completion of typed input (both file names and R code) in the editor is available through the Edit menu 'Complete' or by typing <kbd>&lt;Control&gt;-&lt;.&gt;</kbd> (same as is Xcode). It uses the same facilities as the console window (for compatibility the console responds to both &lt;Tab&gt; and <kbd>&lt;Control&gt;-&lt;.&gt;</kbd>).

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.4 Editor function list</h4>

<p>The editor maintains a popup list of functions defined in the edited document. The list is available in the toolbar and is updated as you type. Selecting a function from that list causes the cursor to jump to the beginning of the function.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.5 Editor  syntax coloring</h4>

<p>The editor supports syntax-highlighting for R code. It is possible to change the syntax highlighting colors using the Syntax Color Preference Pane (see below). Starting with <span class="sc">R.app</span> version 1.17 lazy syntax highlighting is used, which means that changes influencing the entire file (such as typing a single or double quote) no longer apply to the entire file, but only a few lines. This temporary state is usually recovered by closing the quote, but in some rare instances it may persist until a change is made to the first line of the offending quote. However, lazy highlighting brings huge speedup when editing large files.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.6 Editor (internal and external)</h4>

<p>By default, the editor used is incorporated into <span class="sc">R.app</span>, the Mac OS X GUI for R. It is a
relatively simple multi-document editor that supports the features listed above. Additionally,
two powerful commands are available to source the file being edited in its entirety (<kbd>Command-E</kbd>)
or to source the current selection to <acronym>R</acronym> (<kbd>Command-Return</kbd>). Using <acronym>R</acronym>'s <code>edit()</code> function, allows
editing of R objects or files while <acronym>R</acronym> is kept waiting for the edit session to finish.

   <p>It is possible to 'redirect' all <acronym>R</acronym> requests to an external editor, which runs
outside <span class="sc">R.app</span>. In that case, it is not possible to keep <acronym>R</acronym> waiting if <code>edit()</code> is used. Using
AppleScript it is easy to implement <kbd>Command-E</kbd> and <kbd>Command-Return</kbd> like functionality.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.7 Editor help</h4>

<p>The editor contains a light-weight help system in form of a search filed placed inside the toolbar. It is possible to use either an exact or approximate search.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.8 Drag &amp; drop</h4>

<p>Drag and drop of a directory on the <span class="sc">R.app</span> icon while <span class="sc">R.app</span> is not
running will start <span class="sc">R.app</span> and set the working directory. By default
<samp><span class="file">.RData</span></samp> and the history file (default name <samp><span class="file">.Rapp.history</span></samp>)
are fetched from this working directory.  If a file is dropped on the
<span class="sc">R.app</span> icon while <span class="sc">R.app</span> is not running, <span class="sc">R.app</span> is started, the file
is either restored (if it is a saved workspace), sourced into <span class="sc">R.app</span> or
opened in the selected editor. Whether the file is opened or sourced is
specified by a Preference setting in the StartUp Preference Pane.

   <p>Note: At this point opening a file in the editor before <span class="sc">R.app</span> is finished
loading will crash <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

   <p>While <span class="sc">R.app</span> is running, drag &amp; drop of a directory updates the working
directory. Drag &amp; drop of a file sources or opens the file in the
selected editor. Double clicking on files bound to ("Open With ...") R,
if <span class="sc">R.app</span> is not running, <span class="sc">R.app</span> is started and the file is sourced or
opened in editor. If <span class="sc">R.app</span> is running, the file is opened in the
editor.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.9 Help system</h4>

<p>The Help screen allows a user to go back or forward to previous help

found, a pop-up window allows to exit the help search or expand the
search to a fuzzy/approximate search.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.10 History</h4>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> uses history files that are (superset) compatible with history
files created by R. Multiline support remains available from inside
<span class="sc">R.app</span>. Multiline is particularly useful when using the
<kbd>&lt;Command&gt;-&lt;Return&gt;</kbd> feature while editing an R
script. Import and export allows storing and importing history from
files visible in the Mac OS Finder. Multiline is preserved. This can be
set through the StartUp Preference Panel. Default number of kept history
entries is 250. A variety of history entry cleanup modes is possible. 
At a minimum it is suggested to select "Cleanup history entries". It's
optional to select removal of duplicate entries and strip comments.

   <p>Note: Command-line <acronym>R</acronym> stores history in a file usually called
<samp><span class="file">.Rhistory</span></samp>. It is suggested to use a different name for the
<span class="sc">R.app</span> history file, and the default is <samp><span class="file">.Rapp.history</span></samp>.

   <p>Note that the functions <code>loadhistory()</code>, <code>savehistory()</code> and
hence <code>history()</code> are not currently supported in <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.11 Authentication and .libPaths</h4>

<p>The official <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binaries come pre-packaged in such a way that
administrator have sufficient privileges to update R and install
packages system-wide. However, the default Unix build requires
root-authentication for package installation and other administrative
tasks. As it is not feasible to run the GUI as root, we provide the
possibility to authenticate system commands issued from the GUI. The
authentication requires an administrator login and causes all subsequent
system commands to be executed as root. Use with care!

   <p>In order to allow non-administrators to maintain their own set of
packages, <span class="sc">R.app</span> optionally adds <code>~/Library/R/x.y/library</code> to the
<code>.libPaths</code> (see start-up preferences, <code>x.y</code> denotes the R
version without patch level). It is possible to use the Package
Installer to install packages either globally (admin users only) or for
the current user only.  (This is the same mechanism for personal library
directories described in the main <acronym>R</acronym> documentation, but with a location
specific to <acronym>CRAN</acronym>-like builds of <acronym>R</acronym> on OS X.)

   <p>Note that user-local packages are only used when the corresponding
preference option is enabled. The default for admin users is to use
system-wide directories, for non-admin users the personal library
directory will be used.

<h4 class="subsection">4.5.6 Packages Menu</h4>

<p>Using this menu you can have access to the list of packages and
data-sets installed on your system and to the ones on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> or on the
Bioconductor site.

   <p>With the first two menus you can load and detach packages and data-set
from the workspace.  Let's start with the <em>Package Manager</em>. This
opens a window with several columns displayed.  For each package on your
system you can see a check box, the current status of the package
(loaded/not loaded), its name and the package description text. You use
the check box to select/de-select the packages you want.  On window
closure, the checked packaged will be loaded and the unchecked ones (if
loaded) will the detached (not completely as on Mac OS X you cannot
unload completely dynamic libraries).

   <p>The same applies to the <em>Dataset Manager</em> menu but for data-sets.

   <p>You can than get or update packages <acronym>CRAN</acronym> either in binary or source
format. Daily build of <acronym>CRAN</acronym> packages are available for Mac OS X. If
you don't know how to build <acronym>R</acronym> itself from source (see <a href="#Building-R-from-sources">Building R from sources</a>), you'll probably be unable to build packages from source
on your own.  In this case, you should always choose for the binary
option. These binary packages work (for sure!) for the release version
of <acronym>R</acronym> for Mac OS X you find on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> even though it is not excluded
that they will work for other prebuilt versions of <acronym>R</acronym>.

   <p>When you attempt to install packages from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>, <acronym>R</acronym> first tries to
get a connection to the Internet to download the list of available
packages. Than a window will open similar to the one in the package
manager with the only difference that for each package there is also the
information concerning the version of the package installed on your
system (if any) and the version of the prebuilt package available on
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>. When you close the window, the select packages will be
downloaded.

   <p>The same strategy applies to the Bioconductor menu item, with some more
options typical of the Bioconductor way of managing packages.

   <p>For some reason it could happen that you have the package you want to
install (either in binary or source form) on one of your local disks, or
even a directory containing a package source. You can use the last menu
to do the task of installing the package.  Having a package in a
directory form usually applies to people that are developing packages
themselves.

   <p>Note that packages which do not contain C, C++, Fortran <small class="dots">...</small> code
which needs to be compiled can be compiled from their sources with no
additional tools.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.6.0.1 Startup</h5>

<p>The Drag &amp; drop section defines drag &amp; drop behaviour during R
start-up. Options are to open file in an editor or to source
file. Default is to source the file.  The Default Library Paths section
enables, on next start-up of R, to add a directory, e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">~/R/Library</span></samp>, to the library search/install path. The initial
working directory section can be used to enforce the initial working
directory. If no directory is specified, this directory is used as the
default. The Change button allows to select a new directory. The Always
apply selection will enforce the specified intial start-up
directory. The history section controls reading of the history file on
startup. If selected, R will read history file on start-up.  The R
history file field is used to read and store history from/to. This field
can be edited to allow selecting files starting with a period (e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">.Rapp.history</span></samp>). If you want the same history file regardless of
your selected working directory, specify a fixed path (e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">~/.Rapp.history</span></samp>).  The Default button will reset the history file
name to its default value. The History handling area allows setting of
the max number of entries to be kept in history, to remove duplicate
entries, to cleanup history entries (this is very useful to remove blank
lines when submitting multiple lines using Command-Return) and the strip
comments before the entry is added to the history.

<p>If Built-in editor is selected, allows enable/disable of syntax
coloring, brace highlighting and the showing of line numbers. If
External editor is selected, allows specifying which external
editor. That editor will be used for all editing functions. It runs as a
separate application. Using an external editor means that R will never
wait while editing (e.g. <code>edit(A)</code> will return immediately and
open <code>A</code> in the external editor. Command-E and Command-Return like
functionality would need to be implemented by other means,
i.e. AppleScript. The external editor can be any application
(e.g. SubEthaEdit, TextWrangler, BBEdit, Smultron, etc) or can be
activated through a shell script (e.g. see or smultron, both give better
control on how to start the editor).

<p>At the moment the GUI provide direct access/download/installation of
packages located on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>, the Bioconductor repositories or a custom
repository. You can also install packages from local files, either
binary of source packages, as explained below. Otherwise you can use the
appropriate <acronym>R</acronym> commands (see <code>install.packages</code>) to install
packages from a specific location other than the above mentioned ones.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Installation of packages</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> for Mac OS X recognizes packages in two forms: <em>binary</em> packages and <em>source</em> packages.

   <p>Binary packages are <acronym>R</acronym> packages in ready-to-use form, such that no additional tools are necessary for their use. Binary packages are specific for a given <acronym>R</acronym> version and OS. <acronym>CRAN</acronym> and Bioconductor repositories offer <acronym>R</acronym> packages in binary form for the last released <acronym>R</acronym> version. Unlike on other Unix systems, R for Mac OS X installs binary packages by default, i.e. <code>install.packages</code> will look for binary repositories unless instructed otherwise.

   <p>Source packages are general in that they can be used on any platform and OS supported by <acronym>R</acronym>, but they need to be processed and/or compiled before they can be used. Additional tools are necessary for that, see see <a href="#Installation-of-source-packages">Installation of source packages</a> for details. For most users binary packages are sufficient.

   <p>On Mac OS X packages can be installed in three ways:

     <ul>
<li>Using <em>Package Manager</em> in the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI (recommended for most Mac users)

     <li>Using <code>install.packages</code> command in <acronym>R</acronym>

     <li>Using <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> command in the shell (aka <em>Terminal</em>)
</ul>

   <p>The latter two methods are common to all Unix systems and as such described in the general R documentation. In the following we will concentrate on using the <em>Package Installer</em>.

<p class="noindent">If you decide to install packages you should use the <em>Packages &amp; Data</em> menu of the GUI, in particular the sub-item <em>Package Installer</em>. Select the repository, package type (binary or source) and press <em>Get List</em>. This will connect to the repository through the Internet and a list all packages available for installation. The list tells you if a package is already installed on your system, the version of the package available on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> and the version of the same package if already installed.

<p class="noindent">You can use the search field to narrow the list of package to those matching your search criteria. Additionally you can use the search list menu to list only packages that are already installed on your system which is useful for comparing versions of available and installed packages. Finally, you can filter down to packages that have been installed by a previous <acronym>R</acronym> version as to allow a simple upgrade.

<p class="noindent">Select any package you want to install and press the <em>Install</em> button. You can follow the progress of the installation in the <acronym>R</acronym> Console. Once the required packages are installed, the list is re-loaded to reflect the versions of newly installed packages.

<p class="noindent">If you want to update all packages to the latest version, select the repository to use for the packages and press <em>Update All</em>. <acronym>R</acronym> will automatically determine the list of packages that can be updated and present you with a selection of packages to update.

<p class="noindent">You can also download any other package from the Internet yourself and decide to install it from source. In such case select one of the local entries
in the top left list and press the <em>Install</em> button (which is now enabled).

<p class="noindent">Packages can also be installed from other repositories by selecting <em>Other Repository</em> source. Enter the repository URL in the adjacent field. Note that currently the Package Installer assumes that custom repositories maintain proper hierarchy for both source and binary packages the same way <acronym>CRAN</acronym> does when using <em>Other Repository</em>. If your custom repository is flat, select <em>Other Directory URL</em> in the installation type list.

<h3 class="section">5.3 Installation of source packages</h3>

<p>Usually it is much faster and easier to install binary packages, because
they are immediately ready to use. On the other hand only packages that
pass all tests are available in binary form from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. If your
desired package is not available in binary form, you will need to use
its source form.  If you want to install a source package which contains
code that needs compilation, you will need the same working setup for
building R itself (see see <a href="#Building-R-from-sources">Building R from sources</a>), including Apple
Xcode Tools and a working FORTRAN compiler (if the package requires
it).

   <p><strong>Important:</strong> When using binary <acronym>R</acronym> installation from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>,
you must use Xcode 3.1 or higher. Although <acronym>R</acronym> can be built using older
tools, the way it is built depends on the version of the tools and
therefore your must upgrade at least to Xcode 3.1 (or preferably the
latest available) which is compatible with the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> build. Failing to
do so will result in either of the following errors at compile time:

<pre class="example">     make: gcc-4.2: Command not found
     
     cc1: error: invalid option 'macosx-version-min=10.4'
     
     /usr/bin/libtool: unknown option character `m' in: -macosx_version_min
</pre>
   <p>A sign of missing Xcode tools is when the installation fails with
<pre class="example">     make: command not found
</pre>
   <p>In all such cases, please install the most recent Xcode version
available and its `Command Line Tools'.

<h3 class="section">5.4 Building universal packages</h3>

<p>The same binary package can be used for both 32- and 64-bit <acronym>R</acronym> on
Intel-based Macs. Such a package is called <em>universal</em>, because it
works on either platform. Building universal packages requires special
handling. First, <acronym>R</acronym> itself must be compiled as universal binary to
support universal packages at all. The <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binary is built this
way. Finally, a compiler supporting both platforms is necessary.

   <p>Once all tools are in place it is considerably easy to build an
universal binary. If the package does not contain a <em>configure</em>
script then a regular package installation using either
<code>install.packages</code> or <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> automatically creates an
universal binary. If the package contains a <em>configure</em> script then
it cannot be compiled in-place for multiple platforms, and the following
process should be used. Assuming that you have a source package called
<code>foo_1.0.tar.gz</code> that uses a <em>configure</em> script, it can be
installed universally using the following two-step process:

<pre class="example">     # full 64-bit Intel install
     R --arch=x86_64 CMD INSTALL foo_1.0.tar.gz
     # 32-bit Intel library
     R --arch=i386 CMD INSTALL --libs-only foo_1.0.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p>In the first step a full package for the 64-bit Intel platform is built
and installed. In the following steps a package for 32-bit Intel
platform is built, but only the relevant binary libraries are
installed. This way all platforms share the same set of files except for
the package library.

   <p>Alternatively, use

<pre class="example">     R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch foo_1.0.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p>Normally, building a package from sources produces a binary that is tied
to the developer tools that you compiled it with, especially if FORTRAN
is used, because it requires run-time libraries. Anything you compile
with a Fortran requires that you have that Fortran installed at run
time, because Fortran uses its own run-time libraries (if the Fortran
you compiled with used dynamic libraries). This implies that if you
distribute your package you have to tell users to install the same
Fortran you used to compile it.

   <p>However, unlike most other Unix-alikes, Mac users do not necessarily have
development tools installed, so on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> we make an effort to modify
the binaries such that they work even without the tools they have been
compiled with. There are several possible approaches, but since R itself
already uses the same Fortran, we ship a copy of the Fortran libraries
inside R and modify packages such that they use it instead of the one
from developer tools.

   <p>If you want to share a binary with multiple users and don't want to
require them to install Xcode, you can use the same approach as <acronym>CRAN</acronym>
but only if you use the same tools as we do on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. It means to
change the path of the FORTRAN dynamic library (<code>libgfortran</code>) to
point inside the R version that you are compiling for. For example, if
you have installed a universal package <code>FOO</code> for R 2.15.x, you can
change the paths as follows:

<pre class="example">     # change into the library where you installed FOO
     cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library
     # fix the Fortran paths in FOO to point to R 2.15 instead
     for lib in `ls FOO/libs/*/*.so`; do
      install_name_tool -change /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib \
        /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib \
       $lib
     done

<h3 class="section">5.5 Can I install packages built for other platforms?</h3>

<p>As a general rule the answer is <em>yes</em> if the package does not
contain any C/C++/Fortran code in the sources, otherwise the answer is
negative. Another condition is that the package and the installed
version of <acronym>R</acronym> should be the same major release, i.e. you can install a
package built for <acronym>R</acronym> 2.1.0 on <acronym>R</acronym> 2.1.1, but usually not the same
package on <acronym>R</acronym> 2.2.0.

   <p>However, packages without compiled code can be built from their sources
without any additional tools, so simply use <code>install.packages</code> to
install them.

<p class="noindent">A Mac OS X specific requirements is that a prebuilt package is assumed to be named (and accordingly archived and compressed) as <samp><span class="file">package_name.tgz</span></samp>. The build script uses the more common extension <code>.tar.gz</code> and thus the resulting file must be renamed. On Windows, for example, packages come in a zipped format.

<h3 class="section">5.6 Where are the packages I've installed?</h3>

<p>The main library of packages is the one located inside the R.framework
(in <code>/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library</code>). This
library contains the packages (base and recommended ones) distributed
along with <acronym>R</acronym>. Only administrators are allowed to install packages in
this system-wide directory. Note that this directory is
<acronym>R</acronym>-version-specific. Optionally users can install private packages in
their <code>~/Library/R/x.y/library</code> directory where <code>x.y</code> denotes
the R version without the patch level (such as 2.15) &ndash; see the startup
preferences.

<p class="noindent">The Package Installer performs installation to either place depending on the installation target setting. The default for an admin users is to install packages system-wide, whereas the default for regular users is their private place.

<p class="noindent">If you happen to use <code>install.packages</code> <acronym>R</acronym> function instead of the Package Installer, the regular Unix behavior applies (see help pages for details). For default setup this means that the packages are installed according to the startup preference setting. You can check the current defaults by issuing
<pre class="example">     .libPaths()
</pre>
   <!-- @noindent -->
<!-- @strong{Note:} When upgrading to a next major release of @R{}, users should delete their @code{~/Library/R/library} directory, because packages are incompatible across major @R{} versions. When you experience problems loading packages or starting R after an upgrade, make sure you don't have packages for your old @R{} version floating around. More recent versions of @Rapp{} (1.19) include the version number in the path to prevent this from happening. -->

<h3 class="section">6.1 AppleScript support</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> has partial support for Apple-Scripts.  At the moment <acronym>R</acronym> can be
invoked and asked to run commands from an AppleScript script.  What
follows is an example of script that interacts with <acronym>R</acronym>. It first
invokes <acronym>R</acronym> and then sends commands to <acronym>R</acronym> with the <samp><span class="command">cmd</span></samp>
applescript command.

<pre class="example">     set CommandLine to "R.Version()"
     try
     	tell application "R"
     		activate
     		with timeout of 90000 seconds
     			cmd CommandLine
     			cmd "Sys.getenv()"
     			cmd "print(\"HelloWorld!\")"
     		end timeout
     	end tell
     end try
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the above, <samp><span class="command">cmd</span></samp> is the (only) applescript command in the <acronym>R</acronym> dictionary that is
used to tell <acronym>R</acronym> to execute an <acronym>R</acronym> command in the R Console. The syntax is
<pre class="example">     cmd &lt;command string&gt;
</pre>
   <p>where command string have to be in quotes. Actually, the output of the command
is not sent back to the application that is calling <acronym>R</acronym> but to the <acronym>R</acronym> Console directly.

<p class="noindent">There are some issues. The first is that if <acronym>R</acronym> is still not running, it will take a while (depending on
how fast your machine is) to startup. In the meanwhile the script sends commands without waiting and it
could happen that some commands are missed by <acronym>R</acronym>, i.e. they arrive before <acronym>R</acronym> is ready to
receive applescript commands. The second issue, is that it could be that the applescript calls a bad version
of <acronym>R</acronym>. This could happen if you have an old version of <acronym>R</acronym> (for example the old Carbon <acronym>R</acronym>) installed on your
System.

<p class="noindent">As an example, we report here a small script that asks <acronym>R</acronym> to <samp><span class="command">source</span></samp> a file using a file dialog.
<pre class="example">     set file_to_source to (choose file with prompt "Choose file to source") as alias

<h2 class="chapter">7 Quartz device</h2>

<p>The <code>quartz()</code> device is the native graphic device in R for Mac OS
X. Its name derives from Apple's Quartz Technology which is essentially
similar to PDF rendering.

<!-- One of the most amazing features of Quartz is -->
<!-- anti-aliasing which gives you @emph{very nice} plots and images -->
<!-- (although the other standard screen devices for @R{} have also supported -->
<!-- anti-aliasing for several years).  From its PDF nature it is also -->
<!-- resolution independent. -->
<p>The <code>quartz()</code> device can be used from <span class="sc">R.app</span> or a suitable build of <acronym>R</acronym>
running at the Mac console.  Where supported it is the default graphics
device.

version of the quartz device window. Which version will be used depends
on the pasting applications, most modern application will prefer the PDF
version which is of higher quality as it supports vector graphics.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Tcl/Tk issues</h2>

<p>Each binary distribution of <acronym>R</acronym> available through <acronym>CRAN</acronym> is built to
use the X11 implementation of Tcl/Tk.  Of course a X windows server has
to be started first: this should happen automatically on OS X, but can
take quite a while to do so the first time it is used after a reboot.

   <p>If you don't like the X11 style of widgets you would probably want to
build R using the Aqua version of Tcl/Tk (see the `R Installation and
Administration Manual').

<h2 class="chapter">9 Internationalization of the R.app</h2>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> and the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI introduced support for internationalization in
R 2.1.0. Among other things this means that both messages and GUI
elements can be translated into various languages. <span class="sc">R.app</span> automatically
detects user's settings in the <em>International</em> section of the
System Preferences and uses that information to offer translated
messages and GUI if available. Please note that both <em>Language</em> and
<em>Formats</em> information is used so they should be set up
consistently.

   <p>If you use a non-standard setup (e.g. different language than
formats), you can override the auto-detection performed by setting
`<samp><span class="samp">force.LANG</span></samp>' defaults setting, such as for example
<pre class="example">     defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8
</pre>
   <p>when run in <em>Terminal</em> it will enforce US-english setting regardless of the system setting. If you don't know what <em>Terminal</em> is you can use this <acronym>R</acronym> command instead:
<pre class="example">     system("defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8")
</pre>
   <p>but do not forget to quit <acronym>R</acronym> and start <span class="sc">R.app</span> again afterwards. Please note that you must always use `<samp><span class="samp">.UTF-8</span></samp>' version of the locale, otherwise <span class="sc">R.app</span> will not work properly.

   <p>Another change from previous versions (R 2.0 and <span class="sc">R.app</span> 1.01) is the support for UTF-8 character encoding. By default <span class="sc">R.app</span> uses UTF-8 for newly created documents and for the console. When opening new documents <span class="sc">R.app</span> assumes UTF-8 and only if the document violates UTF-8 rules, it will try to fallback to legacy encoding, usually Mac Roman.

   <p>If you are interested in translating <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI into other languages, please read the developer documentation <a href="http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html">http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html</a> for details.

<p>In <span class="sc">R.app</span> you can use the the <em>Stop</em> toolbar button or the &lt;ESC&gt; (escape) key in the console window to interrupt a running calculation or output.

   <p>For the command line version the same is achieved by pressing <kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-c</kbd>. Both applications honor the <code>INT</code> signal, i.e. you can type the following in a separate Terminal window to cancel all R computations:
<pre class="example">     killall -INT R
</pre>
   <p>However, if the executed code does not check for interrupts (using `<samp><span class="samp">R_CheckUserInterrupt</span></samp>') there may be no way of stopping <acronym>R</acronym>. In that case it may be worth alerting the maintainer of the package to allow interruption (if appropriate).

<h3 class="section">12.4 I see spurious error messages when starting R!</h3>

<p>If you see error messages upon start of the R GUI which contain
<code>Library/InputManagers</code> anywhere in the text, then you have some
broken haxxies installed in your system. Those messages do NOT come from
<acronym>R</acronym>, so don't blame us. Bundles located in <code>Library/InputManagers</code>
of your home (or system) are hacks that get loaded into every Mac
application that you start. In most cases you don't see them crashing,
because most applications don't show the console output, but <acronym>R</acronym> does,
so all the errors those hacks are causing become visible. The easiest
remedy is to delete all offending bundles (possibly the whole
<code>Library/InputManagers</code> folder) and get a fixed version of the hack
(if you need it). The most common cause for broken hacks is system
updgrade (e.g. you get a new Mac and you transfer you settings which
include those hacks that are incompatible with your new Mac).

   <p>If you want to disable all external error output in the GUI, use
<pre class="example">     defaults write org.R-project.R 'Ignore stderr' YES
</pre>
   <p>in the Terminal. Note, however, that this will disable <em>all</em> error output from external programs including package installation or the <code>system</code> command.

<h3 class="section">12.5 Which BLAS is used and how can it be changed?</h3>

<p>The BLAS library used by <acronym>R</acronym> depends on the way <acronym>R</acronym> was compiled (see
`R Installation and Administration' manual for details). Current <acronym>R</acronym>
binaries supplied from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> provide both vecLib-based BLAS and
reference BLAS shipped with <acronym>R</acronym>. vecLib is a part of Apple's Accelerate
framework which provides an optimized BLAS implementation for Mac
hardware. Although fast, it is not under our control and may possibly
deliver inaccurate results.

   <p>The <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binary uses <code>--enable-BLAS-shlib</code> option and two Rblas
shared libraries are supplied: <samp><span class="file">libRblas.vecLib.dylib</span></samp> which uses
vecLib BLAS and <samp><span class="file">libRblas.0.dylib</span></samp> which uses reference BLAS from
<acronym>R</acronym>. A symbolic link <samp><span class="file">libRblas.dylib</span></samp> determines which one is
used. Currently the default is to use the <acronym>R</acronym> BLAS is recommended for
precision.

   <p>In order to change which BLAS is used, change the <samp><span class="file">libRblas.dylib</span></samp> symlink correspondingly &ndash; for example in Terminal:
<pre class="example">     cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
     
     # for vecLib use
     ln -sf libRblas.vecLib.dylib libRblas.dylib
     
     # for R reference BLAS use
     ln -sf libRblas.0.dylib libRblas.dylib
</pre>
   <p>This feature is only present in the <acronym>R</acronym> <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binary. Ordinarily compiled <acronym>R</acronym> from sources will only have one of the above BLAS libraries, corresponding to the configuration options used.

<p>The output is not produced continuously during the package installation. Unlike previous GUIs <span class="sc">R.app</span> does its best to display the output as soon as possible, but for example the documentation script does not print anything until done.

   <p>Also note that the development build of <span class="sc">R.app</span> sends output to the error console instead of the screen. You may want to check the <em>Console</em> application in that case.

<h3 class="section">12.7 Why are Quartz plots much bigger than they used to be?</h3>

<p>R versions before 2.7.0 had a Quartz window that was smaller both in
size and scale. This was caused by two &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;: all devices in R have a
default size of 7 inches. Quartz used a default of 5 inches and that was
now changed to match all other devices. In addition, Quartz was
incorrectly assuming a resolution of 72dpi for all screens. This means
that a plot was drawn at ca. 3/4 of its intended size (given that most
modern monitors use 100 dpi or more). The new Quartz device correctly
detects the resolution of a screen by default and thus the plots will
appear larger than they used to be. The resolution can be set using the
<code>dpi</code> parameter of Quartz, i.e. to obtain the old behavior use
<code>quartz(width=5,height=5,dpi=72)</code> when creating a new Quartz
device. If you want to make this your default, use
<code>quartz.options(width=5, height=5, dpi=72)</code>. You can also set those
options in the Quartz Preferences of the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI.

   <p>Some other new features of Quartz in R 2.7.0 include a plot history (use
&lt;Cmd&gt;&lt;Left&gt; and &lt;Cmd&gt;&lt;Right&gt; to browse), improved speed (uses Quartz
Extreme) and the ability to create a variety of output formats (pdf,
png, jpeg, tiff, gif, psd, bmp...) &ndash; see <code>?quartz</code> for
details. Also <code>CarbonEL</code> is no longer needed, Quartz starts its own
even loop when necessary.

<h3 class="section">12.8 Why is Quartz so slow?</h3>

<p>In <acronym>R</acronym> 2.7.0 a new Quartz device was introduced for greater flexibility and speed. It was designed to take advantage of Quartz Extreme and hardware rendering where supported. Nonetheless it turned out that the way lines are drawn can be very slow for certain back-ends if Quartz falls back to software rendering. This issue was addressed in R 2.7.0 patched (r45567 or later). If you experience extreme slowness drawing lines or glitches in drawing, please update to R 2.8.0 or later.

<h3 class="section">12.9 Why are there faint lines in image plots?</h3>

<p>When plots based on the <code>image()</code> function are exported to PDF, Preview shows very faint grid lines at the edges of the rectangles that create the image. Those lines are a rendering artifact in Preview coming from the combination of anti-aliasing and sub-pixel rendering. They are not really a part of the PDF (zooming in will reveal that they are not a real object which would get larger with zoom) since the rectangles are defined as a gapless coverage of the area. The effect can be circumvented by disabling anti-aliasing in Preview.

   <p>We correct for this effect in Quartz when rendering on-screen by snapping all rectangles to pixel boundaries of the screen, but Preview does not.

   <p>The same effect occurs in any plot with adjacent, filled polygons without border.

<h3 class="section">12.10 Why doesn't x86_64 build of R pass make check on Mac OS X 10.5.2?</h3>

<p>Mac OS X 10.5.2 contains a very serious bug that makes <code>log10</code> return incorrect results in 64-bit Intel programs (x86_64). The bug was fixed in Mac OS X 10.5.3 therefore you have to update to Mac OS X 10.5.3 if you want to use 64-bit Intel binaries.

   <p>If you want to create a binary that works on all versions of Mac OS X 10.5, you have to replace <code>log10</code> by something like <code>#define log10(X) (log2(X) * 0x1.34413509F79FFp-2)</code> (see Apple SciTech mailing list for the corresponding discussion and different workarounds).

<h3 class="section">12.11 Why doesn't R GUI support keyboard shortcut XYZ ?</h3>

<p>The <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI uses Apple frameworks for text editing and thus the behavior of text views (console, editor, etc.) is consistent with other applications and allows a very flexible customization. For example if you are not satisfied with the default Emacs-like key bindings that Mac OS X provides, Apple allows you to extend them arbitrarily. For more details see Apple's documentation on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/TextDefaultsBindings/chapter_9_section_2.html">Key Bindings</a>. There are also many 3rd-party pages on key bindings customization, search for <code>StandardKeyBinding.dict</code>.

<h3 class="section">12.12 What is the difference between the Leopard and Tiger builds?</h3>

<p>Before R version 2.11.0 we provided two different binary builds on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>: Tiger (Mac OS X 10.4) and Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5) builds. The Tiger build was a 32-bit build for PowerPC and Intel and works on Mac OS X 10.4 or higher. It was built using the same setup as <acronym>R</acronym> prior to 2.8.0. It included two architectures <code>i386</code> and <code>ppc</code>. The default package type was <code>"mac.binary"</code> and packages in repositories were expected in <samp><span class="file">bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.x</span></samp>.

   <p>In contrast the Leopard build requires Mac OS X 10.5 or higher and thus uses features that are new in Leopard. Also it includes both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. On the console 64-bit version can be started using <code>R --arch=x86_64</code> for Intel Macs or <code>R --arch=ppc64</code> for PowerPC Macs (if included). There are two GUI binaries &ndash; one for 32-bit and one for 64-bit. The Leopard build uses Apple's gcc-4.2 compilers, the default package type is <code>"mac.binary.leopard"</code> and consequently packages are expected in <samp><span class="file">bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.x</span></samp>. Note that some packages may not be available in 64-bit (e.g. if dependent libraries are not available in 64-bit).

<h3 class="section">12.13 What is the difference between the CRAN build and a vanilla build?</h3>

<p>The <acronym>CRAN</acronym> build of R is slightly different from a vanilla build of R, i.e., a simple <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>. The default package type for all builds compiled from sources is <code>"source"</code> wheres <acronym>CRAN</acronym> uses <code>"mac.binary"</code> or <code>"mac.binary.leopard"</code> (see above). Only the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> build is guaranteed to be compatible with the package binaries on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.

   <p>In addition, the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> build contains multiple architectures (two, three or four) and thus corresponds to setting <code>r_arch</code> at configure time and installing each architecture. This poses some challenges for package installation, since packages with a <code>configure</code> script need to be installed several times (see package installation FAQ above). Therefore it is recommended for users to install binary packages instead.

   <p>Further, the start script for the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> build is modified to launch
the current architecture instead of the most recently installed one.

   <p>Since R 2.8.0 the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binary also contains (statically) the most recent FontConfig with configuration and cache located inside R. See the <code>tools</code> directory in <acronym>CRAN</acronym> for the corresponding libraries and details.

<h3 class="section">12.14 Why is R.home() in the R framework not versioned?</h3>

<p>In the command line version of R, <code>R.home()</code> always points to the
<code>Resources</code> directory symbolic link inside the R framework which
points to <code>Versions/Current/Resource</code> which is turn points to the
actual home &ndash; a versioned directory such as for example
<code>Versions/2.15/Resources</code>. This is how framework versioning works
in Mac OS X and is defined by Apple (see
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html">Framework Anatomy</a>).

   <p>The advantage of this setup is that it is possible to install multiple R
versions in parallel and they all will be fully functional as long as
the <code>Current</code> symbolic link points to the currently used
version. There is even a small GUI utility <code>RSwitch</code> available from
the <a href="http://r.research.att.com/">R for Mac devel page</a> that allows
you to select the desired version. In addition, any application
embedding R can choose to use a specific R version (in most cases) or
any version.  Note that <span class="sc">R.app</span> is compiled against a particular version
of <acronym>R</acronym> and it may crash if <code>RSwitch</code> is used to change the version
of <acronym>R</acronym> in use.

   <p>Although it is possible to set <code>R_HOME</code> directly to the versioned
path in the R shell scripts (and thus be able to run different version
in parallel without changing the symbolic link), there are several
dangers lurking there so we don't recommend it. One problem is that
building packages from source won't work. The linker is always linking
against the current version of the framework and therefore only the
currently active version of R can compile packages. Further, packages
may have used the value of <code>R.home()</code> at install time and thus may
not work with incorrect setting.  Finally, if such an R start script
happens to get copied and the R version changes, it will stop working.

<h3 class="section">12.15 R.app GUI crashes on startup!</h3>

<p>If your <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI crashes on startup, there are two common causes for
this: a saved workspace or a corrupted history file.  (Another is a
mismatch between <span class="sc">R.app</span> and <acronym>R</acronym> if either has been updated or
<samp><span class="command">RSwitch</span></samp> has been used.)

   <p>Saved workspaces can contain commands that implicitly load packages
which in turn can trigger bugs in packages or feed R with incorrect
starting values (especially if it was saved using another R). Try
removing or renaming your workspace &ndash; it's called <code>.RData</code>. If you
did not change your startup settings, you can e.g. use

<pre class="example">     mv ~/.RData ~/workspace.RData
</pre>
   <p>to move it aside and load later manually for inspection using <code>load("~/workspace.RData")</code>.

   <p>Second most common cause of crashes on startup is a history file that
was not created using the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI. Again, move it aside to see if
that's the issue: for the default file this could be done by

<pre class="example">     mv ~/.Rapp.history ~/history.txt
</pre>
   <p>Although we are trying to recover from invalid history files, they can
still crash <span class="sc">R.app</span> due to issues in the internal handling of strings in
Mac OS X. We are currently working on preventing this issue.

   <p>If you did both of the above and <span class="sc">R.app</span> still crashes, please select
`1' in the menu after the crash (if you get the crash menu in the
console) and send us the resulting crash report (see see <a href="#R_002eapp-Bugs">R.app Bugs</a>
above).

<h3 class="section">12.16 R.app GUI does not save the workspace!</h3>

<p>When you quit the R.app GUI it asks you whether to save the workspace or
not. There was a bug in R.app GUI 1.32 (shipped with the initial release
of R 2.11.0) that did not save the workspace even if told to. If you use
R.app GUI version 1.32 please make sure you upgrade to 1.33 (or higher)
to avoid this bug. The current R on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> ships with the more recent
R.app GUI version that does not exhibit the problem.

<h3 class="section">12.17 Why is the GUI not saving my history?</h3>

<p>In some older versions of R there was a conflict between the history of
R itself and the GUI such that the history file will be always empty. In
R 2.11.1 the default has been changed such that the GUI will by default
use a <code>.Rapp.history</code> file whereas command line <acronym>R</acronym> will use
<code>.Rhistory</code>. If you have old preferences, go to Preferences -&gt;
Startup in the GUI and click on the Default button next to the R history
file text box and close the preferences.

   <p>Note that calling <code>savehistory()</code> in <span class="sc">R.app</span> does not currently
save the history of the <span class="sc">R.app</span> session: this means that
<code>history()</code> will usually show an empty window.

<h3 class="section">12.18 I get &ldquo;command not found&rdquo; in the GUI yet it works in the Terminal &ndash; why?</h3>

<p>When executing system commands (for example directly via <code>system</code> or indirectly via functions that call other programs such as <code>install.packages</code>) the locations in which the shell is looking for programs is governed by the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. That variable may be set differently for R started from an interactive shell and for R started in the GUI. You can use <code>Sys.getenv("PATH")</code> to verify the current setting.

   <p>When R is started from a shell (e.g., on the command line of the Terminal), it will inherit settings from that shell. Those are typically modified by shell-specific configuration files, such as <code>.profile</code> or <code>.bashrc</code>. Those apply only to the shell, not to the system as a whole. In addition, some installers (such as MacTeX) will modify global shell settings to make user's life more comfortable on the command line, but, again, those do not apply to programs not started from the shell &ndash; such as GUIs. See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1067">Apple Technical Q&amp;A QA1067</a> for what Apple says about the topic.

   <p>In order to standardize your <code>PATH</code> setting in R, you can set it in
your <code>.Renviron</code> file (in your home directory &ndash; see <code>?Startup</code>
in R for details on how R uses configuration files on startup). This
setting will apply to R regardless of how it is started. You can also
add more elaborate constructs to <code>.Rprofile</code> instead if you wish to
selectively modify the existing <code>PATH</code> variable via
<code>Sys.getenv</code> and <code>Sys.setenv</code>.

<p>Typically this means that you have corrupted fonts in your system. Open
the <code>Font Book</code> application (in <code>Applications</code>) and check the
fonts that you are using (for example the default font in Quartz is
&ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo;). Corrupted fonts will have no glyphs (text will not
appear as it should), remove such fonts.
