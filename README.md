iNZightVIT for MAC
==================
This version is build using older versions of packages, and is for users running OS X 10.6 or lower (although not guaranteed on lower versions).

If you are running 10.9.2 (Mavericks), please use iNZightVIT-MAC from:
<http://www.github.com/iNZightVIT/iNZightVIT-MAC/>

-----

If you have already attempted to use the older version, you will first need to remove the latest version of GTK+ from your system. To do this, open up the Finder, press COMMAND+SHIFT+G, and type in `/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Versions`. This should open a folder containing the installed versions of GTK+. Delete the folder (if it exists) called `2.24.X11` (you will need to provide an admin password to do so). Once this is done, if you already have the folder `2.18.X11`, then you can skip installing GTK+, otherwise you will need to install from:
<http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg>


Once this is done, you can downloade the iNZightVIT release by the DOWNLOAD ZIP link on the bottom of the right column.
