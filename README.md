iNZightVIT for MAC
==================
This version is build using older versions of packages, and is for users running OS X 10.6 or lower (although not guaranteed on lower versions).

If you are running 10.9.2 (Mavericks), please use iNZightVIT-MAC from:
<http://www.github.com/iNZightVIT/iNZightVIT-MAC/>

-----

If you have already attempted to use the older version, you will need to install the older version of GTK+ from:
<http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg>
(Even if you have already installed 2.18, you will need to reinstall it so R uses this version instead of 2.24).


Once this is done, you can [download the iNZightVIT](https://github.com/iNZightVIT/iNZightVIT-MAC-2.15/archive/master.zip).
