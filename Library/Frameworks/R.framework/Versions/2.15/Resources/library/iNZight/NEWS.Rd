\section{Changes in version 2.0.1}{
  Release date: 27 March 2014
  
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Identify feature added to the "Add To Plot" menu. This
      allows users to interactively label points with `id` or any other
      variable. This feature works for both dot plots and scatter plots.
    }
  }
  
  \subsection{MINOR CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Users can force scatter plots when the sample size is large,
      rather than using the alternative grid-density plot.

      \item Missing observations can be converted to categorical
      levels. For categorical variables, the result is a new factor with
      the same levels as the original variable, but the additional
      `missing` factor level. For continuous variables, a new factor
      variable with two levels, `missing` and `not missing` is created.
    }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Vertical sliders added to the `Rename Levels` and `Rename
      factor levels` windows.

      \item Reorder levels now works as expected, including sort by
      frequency.

      \item Bug where the iNZight window closes even if a user clicks
      `cancel` has been fixed.
    }
  }
}

      \item The entire iNZight module of iNZightVIT has been rewritten,
      with a multitude of changes along the way.
      
    }
