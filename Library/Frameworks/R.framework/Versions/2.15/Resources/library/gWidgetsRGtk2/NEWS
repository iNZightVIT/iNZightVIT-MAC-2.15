Dear Emacs, please make this -*-Text-*- mode!

     	    NEWS for gWidgetsRGtk2

Changes for version 0.0-81

Changes for version 0.0-79
--------------------------

* fix to gdf and do.subset=TRUE. (Thanks Stephanie)

* fix to font.attr argument of insert method for gtext. (Had commented
  out for speed, but forgot to fix ...) THanks Yvonnick.

  formal one with newer gWidgets


Changes for version 0.0-75

--------------------------

  of the message with a recent GTK. However, removed support for
  popping stack of messages. Likely not an issue, but can be put back
  if requested.

* fix to gradio to avoid premature garbage collection leading to crash
  under tctorture. There may still be an issue with gbutton. (If so,
  pass in a parent container to the constructor.)

  class. Cleans up the code considerably.
