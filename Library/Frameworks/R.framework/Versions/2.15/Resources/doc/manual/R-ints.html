<h2 class="chapter">1 R Internal Structures</h2>

<p>This chapter is the beginnings of documentation about R internal
structures.  It is written for the core team and others studying the
code in the <samp><span class="file">src/main</span></samp> directory.

   <p>It is a work-in-progress, first begun for R 2.4.0, and should be
checked against the current version of the source code.

<h3 class="section">1.1 SEXPs</h3>

<p><a name="index-SEXP-1"></a><a name="index-SEXPRREC-2"></a>What R users think of as <em>variables</em> or <em>objects</em> are
symbols which are bound to a value.  The value can be thought of as
either a <code>SEXP</code> (a pointer), or the structure it points to, a
<code>SEXPREC</code> (and there are alternative forms used for vectors, namely
<code>VECSXP</code> pointing to <code>VECTOR_SEXPREC</code> structures). 
So the basic building blocks of R objects are often called
<em>nodes</em>, meaning <code>SEXPREC</code>s or <code>VECTOR_SEXPREC</code>s.

   <p>Note that the internal structure of the <code>SEXPREC</code> is not made
available to R Extensions: rather <code>SEXP</code> is an opaque pointer,
and the internals can only be accessed by the functions provided.

   <p><a name="index-node-3"></a>Both types of node structure have as their first three fields a 32-bit
<code>sxpinfo</code> header and then three pointers (to the attributes and the
previous and next node in a doubly-linked list), and then some further
fields.  On a 32-bit platform a node<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> occupies 28 bytes: on a 64-bit platform typically 56
bytes (depending on alignment constraints).

   <p>The first five bits of the <code>sxpinfo</code> header specify one of up to 32
<code>SEXPTYPE</code>s.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 SEXPTYPEs</h4>

<p><a name="index-SEXPTYPE-4"></a>Currently <code>SEXPTYPE</code>s 0:10 and 13:25 are in use.  Values 11 and 12
were used for internal factors and ordered factors and have since been
withdrawn.  Note that the <code>SEXPTYPE</code> numbers are stored in
<code>save</code>d objects and that the ordering of the types is used, so the
gap cannot easily be reused.

   <p><a name="index-atomic-vector-type-6"></a>Many of these will be familiar from R level: the atomic vector types
are <code>LGLSXP</code>, <code>INTSXP</code>, <code>REALSXP</code>, <code>CPLXSP</code>,
<code>STRSXP</code> and <code>RAWSXP</code>.  Lists are <code>VECSXP</code> and names
(also known as symbols) are <code>SYMSXP</code>.  Pairlists (<code>LISTSXP</code>,
the name going back to the origins of R as a Scheme-like language)
are rarely seen at R level, but are for example used for argument
lists.  Character vectors are effectively lists all of whose elements
are <code>CHARSXP</code>, a type that is rarely visible at R level.

   <p><a name="index-language-object-7"></a><a name="index-argument-list-8"></a>Language objects (<code>LANGSXP</code>) are calls (including formulae and so
on).  Internally they are pairlists with first element a
reference<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> to the function to be called with remaining elements the
actual arguments for the call (and with the tags if present giving the
specified argument names).  Although this is not enforced, many places
in the code assume that the pairlist is of length one or more, often
without checking.

   <p><a name="index-expression-9"></a>Expressions are of type <code>EXPRSXP</code>: they are a vector of (usually
language) objects most often seen as the result of <code>parse()</code>.

   <p><a name="index-function-10"></a>The functions are of types <code>CLOSXP</code>, <code>SPECIALSXP</code> and
<code>BUILTINSXP</code>: where <code>SEXPTYPE</code>s are stored in an integer
these are sometimes lumped into a pseudo-type <code>FUNSXP</code> with code
99.  Functions defined via <code>function</code> are of type <code>CLOSXP</code> and
have formals, body and environment.

   <p><a name="index-S4-type-11"></a>The <code>SEXPTYPE</code> <code>S4SXP</code> is for S4 objects which do not consist
solely of a simple type such as an atomic vector or function.  Prior to
R 2.4.0 these were represented as empty lists.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Rest of header</h4>

<p>The <code>sxpinfo</code> header is defined as a 32-bit C structure by

<pre class="example">     struct sxpinfo_struct {
         SEXPTYPE type      :  5;  /* <span class="roman">discussed above</span> */
         unsigned int obj   :  1;  /* <span class="roman">is this an object with a class attribute?</span> */
         unsigned int named :  2;  /* <span class="roman">used to control copying</span> */
         unsigned int gp    : 16;  /* <span class="roman">general purpose, see below</span> */
         unsigned int mark  :  1;  /* <span class="roman">mark object as ‘in use’ in GC</span> */
         unsigned int debug :  1;
         unsigned int trace :  1;
         unsigned int spare :  1;  /* <span class="roman">unused</span> */
         unsigned int gcgen :  1;  /* <span class="roman">generation for GC</span> */
         unsigned int gccls :  3;  /* <span class="roman">class of node for GC</span> */
     };  /*              Tot: 32 */
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-debug-bit-12"></a>The <code>debug</code> bit is used for closures and environments.  For
closures it is set by <code>debug()</code> and unset by <code>undebug()</code>, and
indicates that evaluations of the function should be run under the
browser.  For environments it indicates whether the browsing is in
single-step mode.

   <p><a name="index-trace-bit-13"></a>The <code>trace</code> bit is used for functions for <code>trace()</code> and for
other objects when tracing duplications (see <code>tracemem</code>).

   <p><a name="index-named-bit-14"></a><a name="index-NAMED-15"></a><a name="index-SET_005fNAMED-16"></a><a name="index-copying-semantics-17"></a>The <code>named</code> field is set and accessed by the <code>SET_NAMED</code> and
<code>NAMED</code> macros, and take values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. 
R has a ‘call by value’ illusion, so an assignment like
<pre class="example">     b &lt;- a
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">appears to make a copy of <code>a</code> and refer to it as <code>b</code>. 
However, if neither <code>a</code> nor <code>b</code> are subsequently altered there
is no need to copy.  What really happens is that a new symbol <code>b</code>
is bound to the same value as <code>a</code> and the <code>named</code> field on the
value object is set (in this case to <code>2</code>).  When an object is about
to be altered, the <code>named</code> field is consulted.  A value of <code>2</code>
means that the object must be duplicated before being changed.  (Note
that this does not say that it is necessary to duplicate, only that it
should be duplicated whether necessary or not.)  A value of <code>0</code>
means that it is known that no other <code>SEXP</code> shares data with this
object, and so it may safely be altered.  A value of <code>1</code> is used
for situations like

<pre class="example">     dim(a) &lt;- c(7, 2)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where in principle two copies of <code>a</code> exist for the duration of the
computation as (in principle)

avoid a copy in this case.

   <p>The <code>gp</code> bits are by definition ‘general purpose’.  We label these
from 0 to 15.  Bits 0&ndash;5 and bits 14&ndash;15 have been used as described below
(mainly from detective work on the sources).

   <p><a name="index-gp-bits-18"></a><a name="index-LEVELS-19"></a><a name="index-SETLEVELS-20"></a>The bits can be accessed and set by the <code>LEVELS</code> and
<code>SETLEVELS</code> macros, which names appear to date back to the internal
factor and ordered types and are now used in only a few places in the
code.  The <code>gp</code> field is serialized/unserialized for the
<code>SEXPTYPE</code>s other than <code>NILSXP</code>, <code>SYMSXP</code> and
<code>ENVSXP</code>.

   <p>Bits 14 and 15 of <code>gp</code> are used for ‘fancy bindings’.  Bit 14 is
used to lock a binding or an environment, and bit 15 is used to indicate
an active binding.  (For the definition of an ‘active binding’ see the
header comments in file <samp><span class="file">src/main/envir.c</span></samp>.)  Bit 15 is used for an
environment to indicate if it participates in the global cache.

   <p><a name="index-ARGSUSED-21"></a><a name="index-SET_005fARGUSED-22"></a>The macros <code>ARGUSED</code> and <code>SET_ARGUSED</code> are used when matching
actual and formal function arguments, and take the values 0, 1 and 2.

   <p><a name="index-MISSING-23"></a><a name="index-SET_005fMISSING-24"></a>The macros <code>MISSING</code> and <code>SET_MISSING</code> are used for pairlists
of arguments.  Four bits are reserved, but only two are used (and
exactly what for is not explained).  It seems that bit 0 is used by
<code>matchArgs</code> to mark missingness on the returned argument list, and
bit 1 is used to mark the use of a default value for an argument copied
to the evaluation frame of a closure.

indicates that a <code>SYMSXP</code> is one of the symbols <code>..n</code> which
are implicitly created when <code>...</code> is processed, and so indicates
that it may need to be looked up in a <code>DOTSXP</code>.

   <p><a name="index-PRSEEN-28"></a><a name="index-promise-29"></a>Bit 0 is used for <code>PRSEEN</code>, a flag to indicate if a promise has
already been seen during the evaluation of the promise (and so to avoid
recursive loops).

   <p>Bit 0 is used for <code>HASHASH</code>, on the <code>PRINTNAME</code> of the
<code>TAG</code> of the frame of an environment. (This bit is not serialized
for <code>CHARSXP</code> objects.)

   <p>Bits 0 and 1 are used for weak references (to indicate `ready to
finalize', ‘finalize on exit’).

   <p>Bit 0 is used by the condition handling system (on a <code>VECSXP</code>) to
indicate a calling handler.

   <p>Bit 4 is turned on to mark S4 objects.

   <p>Bits 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are used for a <code>CHARSXP</code> to denote its
encoding.  Bit 1 indicates that the <code>CHARSXP</code> should be treated as
a set of bytes, not necessarily representing a character in any known
encoding.  Bits 2, 3 and 6 are used to indicate that it is known to be
in Latin-1, UTF-8 or ASCII respectively.

   <p>Bit 5 for a <code>CHARSXP</code> indicates that it is hashed by its address,
that is <code>NA_STRING</code> or is in the <code>CHARSXP</code> cache (this is not
serialized).  Only exceptionally is a <code>CHARSXP</code> not hashed, and
this should never happen in end-user code.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.3 The ‘data’</h4>

<p>A <code>SEXPREC</code> is a C structure containing the 32-bit header as
described above, three pointers (to the attributes, previous and next
node) and the node data, a union

<pre class="example">     union {
         struct primsxp_struct primsxp;
         struct symsxp_struct symsxp;
         struct listsxp_struct listsxp;
         struct envsxp_struct envsxp;
         struct closxp_struct closxp;
         struct promsxp_struct promsxp;
     } u;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All of these alternatives apart from the first (an <code>int</code>) are three
pointers, so the union occupies three words.

   <p><a name="index-vector-type-30"></a>The vector types are <code>RAWSXP</code>, <code>CHARSXP</code>, <code>LGLSXP</code>,
<code>INTSXP</code>, <code>REALSXP</code>, <code>CPLXSXP</code>, <code>STRSXP</code>,
<code>VECSXP</code>, <code>EXPRSXP</code> and <code>WEAKREFSXP</code>.  Remember that such
types are a <code>VECTOR_SEXPREC</code>, which again consists of the header
and the same three pointers, but followed by two integers giving the
length and ‘true length’<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the vector, and then followed by the data (aligned as
required: on most 32-bit systems with a 24-byte <code>VECTOR_SEXPREC</code>
node the data can follow immediately after the node).  The data are a
block of memory of the appropriate length to store ‘true length’
elements (rounded up to a multiple of 8 bytes, with the 8-byte blocks
being the ‘Vcells’ referred in the documentation for <code>gc()</code>).

   <p>The ‘data’ for the various types are given in the table below.  A lot of
this is interpretation, i.e. the types are not checked.

     <dl>
<dt><code>NILSXP</code><dd>There is only one object of type <code>NILSXP</code>, <code>R_NilValue</code>, with
no data.

     <br><dt><code>SYMSXP</code><dd>Pointers to three nodes, the name, value and internal, accessed by
<code>PRINTNAME</code> (a <code>CHARSXP</code>), <code>SYMVALUE</code> and
<code>INTERNAL</code>.  (If the symbol's value is a <code>.Internal</code> function,
the last is a pointer to the appropriate <code>SEXPREC</code>.)  Many symbols
have <code>SYMVALUE</code> <code>R_UnboundValue</code>.

     <br><dt><code>LISTSXP</code><dd>Pointers to the CAR, CDR (usually a <code>LISTSXP</code> or <code>NULL</code>) and
TAG (a <code>SYMSXP</code> or <code>NULL</code>).

     <br><dt><code>CLOSXP</code><dd>Pointers to the formals (a pairlist), the body and the environment.

     <br><dt><code>ENVSXP</code><dd>Pointers to the frame, enclosing environment and hash table (<code>NULL</code> or a
<code>VECSXP</code>).  A frame is a tagged pairlist with tag the symbol and
CAR the bound value.

     <br><dt><code>PROMSXP</code><dd>Pointers to the value, expression and environment (in which to evaluate
the expression).  Once an promise has been evaluated, the environment is
set to <code>NULL</code>.

     <br><dt><code>LANGSXP</code><dd>A special type of <code>LISTSXP</code> used for function calls.  (The CAR
references the function (perhaps via a symbol or language object), and
the CDR the argument list with tags for named arguments.)  R-level
documentation references to ‘expressions’ / ‘language objects’ are
mainly <code>LANGSXP</code>s, but can be symbols (<code>SYMSXP</code>s) or

(<code>SEXP</code>s pointing to <code>CHARSXP</code>s).

     <br><dt><code>DOTSXP</code><dd>A special type of <code>LISTSXP</code> for the value bound to a <code>...</code>
symbol: a pairlist of promises.

of this type.

     <br><dt><code>VECSXP</code><dt><code>EXPRSXP</code><dd><code>length</code>, <code>truelength</code> followed by a block of pointers.  These

     <br><dt><code>BCODESXP</code><dd>For the ‘byte-code’ objects generated by the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>EXTPTRSXP</code><dd>Has three pointers, to the pointer, the protection value (an R object
which if alive protects this object) and a tag (a <code>SYMSXP</code>?).

<h3 class="section">1.2 Environments and variable lookup</h3>

<p><a name="index-environment-32"></a><a name="index-variable-lookup-33"></a>What users think of as ‘variables’ are symbols which are bound to
objects in ‘environments’.  The word ‘environment’ is used ambiguously
in R to mean <em>either</em> the frame of an <code>ENVSXP</code> (a pairlist
of symbol-value pairs) <em>or</em> an <code>ENVSXP</code>, a frame plus an
enclosure.

   <p><a name="index-user-databases-34"></a>There are additional places that ‘variables’ can be looked up, called
‘user databases’ in comments in the code.  These seem undocumented in
the R sources, but apparently refer to the <strong>RObjectTable</strong> package
at <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RObjectTables/">http://www.omegahat.org/RObjectTables/</a>.

   <p><a name="index-base-environment-35"></a><a name="index-environment_002c-base-36"></a>The base environment is special.  There is an <code>ENVSXP</code> environment
with enclosure the empty environment <code>R_EmptyEnv</code>, but the frame of
that environment is not used.  Rather its bindings are part of the
global symbol table, being those symbols in the global symbol table
whose values are not <code>R_UnboundValue</code>.  When R is started the
internal functions are installed (by C code) in the symbol table, with
primitive functions having values and <code>.Internal</code> functions having
what would be their values in the field accessed by the <code>INTERNAL</code>
macro.  Then <code>.Platform</code> and <code>.Machine</code> are computed and the
base package is loaded into the base environment followed by the system
profile.

   <p>The frames of environments (and the symbol table) are normally hashed
for faster access (including insertion and deletion).

   <p>By default R maintains a (hashed) global cache of ‘variables’ (that
is symbols and their bindings) which have been found, and this refers
only to environments which have been marked to participate, which
consists of the global environment (aka the user workspace), the base
environment plus environments<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a> which have been <code>attach</code>ed.  When an environment is either
<code>attach</code>ed or <code>detach</code>ed, the names of its symbols are flushed
from the cache.  The cache is used whenever searching for variables from
the global environment (possibly as part of a recursive search).

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 Search paths</h4>

<p><a name="index-search-path-37"></a>S has the notion of a ‘search path’: the lookup for a ‘variable’
leads (possibly through a series of frames) to the ‘session frame’ the
‘working directory’ and then along the search path.  The search path is
a series of databases (as returned by <code>search()</code>) which contain the
system functions (but not necessarily at the end of the path, as by
default the equivalent of packages are added at the end).

   <p>R has a variant on the S model.  There is a search path (also
returned by <code>search()</code>) which consists of the global environment
(aka user workspace) followed by environments which have been attached
and finally the base environment.  Note that unlike S it is not
possible to attach environments before the workspace nor after the base
environment.

   <p>However, the notion of variable lookup is more general in R, hence
the plural in the title of this subsection.  Since environments have
enclosures, from any environment there is a search path found by looking
in the frame, then the frame of its enclosure and so on.  Since loops
are not allowed, this process will eventually terminate: it can
terminate at either the base environment or the empty environment.  (It
can be conceptually simpler to think of the search always terminating at
the empty environment, but with an optimization to stop at the base
environment.)  So the ‘search path’ describes the chain of environments
which is traversed once the search reaches the global environment.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.2 Namespaces</h4>

<p><a name="index-namespace-38"></a>Namespaces are environments associated with packages (and once again
the base package is special and will be considered separately).  A
package <var>pkg</var> with a namespace defines two environments
<code>namespace:</code><var>pkg</var> and <code>package:</code><var>pkg</var>: it is
<code>package:</code><var>pkg</var> that can be <code>attach</code>ed and form part of
the search path.

   <p>The objects defined by the R code in the package are symbols with
bindings in the <code>namespace:</code><var>pkg</var> environment.  The
<code>package:</code><var>pkg</var> environment is populated by selected symbols
from the <code>namespace:</code><var>pkg</var> environment (the exports).  The
enclosure of this environment is an environment populated with the
explicit imports from other namespaces, and the enclosure of
<em>that</em> environment is the base namespace.  (So the illusion of the
imports being in the namespace environment is created via the
environment tree.)  The enclosure of the base namespace is the global
environment, so the search from a package namespace goes via the
(explicit and implicit) imports to the standard ‘search path’.

   <p><a name="index-base-namespace-39"></a><a name="index-namespace_002c-base-40"></a><a name="index-R_005fBaseNamespace-41"></a>The base namespace environment <code>R_BaseNamespace</code> is another
<code>ENVSXP</code> that is special-cased.  It is effectively the same thing
as the base environment <code>R_BaseEnv</code> <em>except</em> that its
enclosure is the global environment rather than the empty environment:
the internal code diverts lookups in its frame to the global symbol
table.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.3 Hash table</h4>

<p>Environments in R usually have a hash table, and nowadays that is the
default in <code>new.env()</code>.  It is stored as a <code>VECSXP</code> where
<code>length</code> is used for the allocated size of the table and
<code>truelength</code> is the number of primary slots in use&mdash;the pointer to
the <code>VECSXP</code> is part of the header of a <code>SEXP</code> of type
<code>ENVSXP</code>, and this points to <code>R_NilValue</code> if the environment
is not hashed.

   <p>For the pros and cons of hashing, see a basic text on Computer Science.

   <p>The code to implement hashed environments is in <samp><span class="file">src/main/envir.c</span></samp>. 
Unless set otherwise (e.g. by the <code>size</code> argument of
<code>new.env()</code>) the initial table size is <code>29</code>.  The table will
be resized by a factor of 1.2 once the load factor (the proportion of
primary slots in use) reaches 85%.

   <p>The hash chains are stored as pairlist elements of the <code>VECSXP</code>:
items are inserted at the front of the pairlist.  Hashing is principally
designed for fast searching of environments, which are from time to time
added to but rarely deleted from, so items are not actually deleted but
have their value set to <code>R_UnboundValue</code>.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Attributes</h3>

<p><a name="index-attributes-42"></a><a name="index-ATTRIB-43"></a><a name="index-SET_005fATTRIB-44"></a><a name="index-DUPLICATE_005fATTRIB-45"></a>As we have seen, every <code>SEXPREC</code> has a pointer to the attributes of
the node (default <code>R_NilValue</code>).  The attributes can be
accessed/set by the macros/functions <code>ATTRIB</code> and
<code>SET_ATTRIB</code>, but such direct access is normally only used to check
if the attributes are <code>NULL</code> or to reset them.  Otherwise access
goes through the functions <code>getAttrib</code> and <code>setAttrib</code> which
impose restrictions on the attributes.  One thing to watch is that if
you copy attributes from one object to another you may (un)set the
<code>"class"</code> attribute and so need to copy the object and S4 bits as
well.  There is a macro/function <code>DUPLICATE_ATTRIB</code> to automate
this.

   <p>Note that the ‘attributes’ of a <code>CHARSXP</code> are used as part of the
management of the <code>CHARSXP</code> cache: of course <code>CHARSXP</code>'s are
not user-visible but C-level code might look at their attributes.

   <p>The code assumes that the attributes of a node are either
<code>R_NilValue</code> or a pairlist of non-zero length (and this is checked
by <code>SET_ATTRIB</code>).  The attributes are named (via tags on the
pairlist).  The replacement function <code>attributes&lt;-</code> ensures that
<code>"dim"</code> precedes <code>"dimnames"</code> in the pairlist.  Attribute
<code>"dim"</code> is one of several that is treated specially: the values are
checked, and any <code>"names"</code> and <code>"dimnames"</code> attributes are
removed.  Similarly, you cannot set <code>"dimnames"</code> without having set
<code>"dim"</code>, and the value assigned must be a list of the correct
length and with elements of the correct lengths (and all zero-length
elements are replaced by <code>NULL</code>).

   <p>The other attributes which are given special treatment are
<code>"names"</code>, <code>"class"</code>, <code>"tsp"</code>, <code>"comment"</code> and
<code>"row.names"</code>.  For pairlist-like objects the names are not stored
as an attribute but (as symbols) as the tags: however the R interface
makes them look like conventional attributes, and for one-dimensional
arrays they are stored as the first element of the <code>"dimnames"</code>
attribute.  The C code ensures that the <code>"tsp"</code> attribute is an
<code>REALSXP</code>, the frequency is positive and the implied length agrees
with the number of rows of the object being assigned to.  Classes and
comments are restricted to character vectors, and assigning a
zero-length comment or class removes the attribute.  Setting or removing
a <code>"class"</code> attribute sets the object bit appropriately.  Integer
row names are converted to and from the internal compact representation.

   <p><a name="index-copying-semantics-46"></a>Care needs to be taken when adding attributes to objects of the types
with non-standard copying semantics.  There is only one object of type
<code>NILSXP</code>, <code>R_NilValue</code>, and that should never have attributes
(and this is enforced in <code>installAttrib</code>).  For environments,
external pointers and weak references, the attributes should be relevant
to all uses of the object: it is for example reasonable to have a name
for an environment, and also a <code>"path"</code> attribute for those
environments populated from R code in a package.

   <p><a name="index-attributes_002c-preserving-47"></a><a name="index-preserving-attributes-48"></a>When should attributes be preserved under operations on an object? 
Becker, Chambers &amp; Wilks (1988, pp. 144&ndash;6) give some guidance.  Scalar
functions (those which operate element-by-element on a vector and whose
output is similar to the input) should preserve attributes (except
perhaps class, and if they do preserve class they need to preserve the
<code>OBJECT</code> and S4 bits).  Binary operations normally call
<a name="index-copyMostAttributes-49"></a><code>copyMostAttributes</code> to copy most attributes from the longer
argument (and if they are of the same length from both, preferring the
values on the first).  Here ‘most’ means all except the <code>names</code>,
<code>dim</code> and <code>dimnames</code> which are set appropriately by the code
for the operator.

   <p>Subsetting (other than by an empty index) generally drops all attributes
except <code>names</code>, <code>dim</code> and <code>dimnames</code> which are reset as
appropriate.  On the other hand, subassignment generally preserves such
attributes even if the length is changed.  Coercion drops all
attributes. For example:

<pre class="example">     &gt; x &lt;- structure(1:8, names=letters[1:8], comm="a comment")
     &gt; x[]
     a b c d e f g h

<h3 class="section">1.4 Contexts</h3>

<p><a name="index-context-50"></a><em>Contexts</em> are the internal mechanism used to keep track of where a
computation has got to (and from where), so that control-flow constructs
can work and reasonable information can be produced on error conditions
(such as <em>via</em> traceback), and otherwise (the <code>sys.</code><var>xxx</var>
functions).

<h3 class="section">1.5 Argument evaluation</h3>

<p><a name="index-argument-evaluation-53"></a>As we have seen, functions in R come in three types, closures
(<code>SEXPTYPE</code> <code>CLOSXP</code>), specials (<code>SPECIALSXP</code>) and
builtins (<code>BUILTINSXP</code>).  In this section we consider when (and if)
the actual arguments of function calls are evaluated.  The rules are
different for the internal (special/builtin) and R-level functions
(closures).

   <p>For a call to a closure, the actual and formal arguments are matched and
a matched call (another <code>LANGSXP</code>) is constructed.  This process
first replaces the actual argument list by a list of promises to the
values supplied.  It then constructs a new environment which contains
the names of the formal parameters matched to actual or default values:
all the matched values are promises, the defaults as promises to be
evaluated in the environment just created.  That environment is then
used for the evaluation of the body of the function, and promises will
be forced (and hence actual or default arguments evaluated) when they
are encountered. 
<a name="index-NAMED-54"></a>(Evaluating a promise sets <code>NAMED = 2</code> on its value, so if the
argument was a symbol its binding is regarded as having multiple
references during the evaluation of the closure call.)

   <p>If the closure is an S3 generic (that is, contains a call to
<code>UseMethod</code>) the evaluation process is the same until the
<code>UseMethod</code> call is encountered.  At that point the argument on
which to do dispatch (normally the first) will be evaluated if it has
not been already.  If a method has been found which is a closure, a new
evaluation environment is created for it containing the matched
arguments of the method plus any new variables defined so far during the
evaluation of the body of the generic.  (Note that this means changes to
the values of the formal arguments in the body of the generic are
discarded when calling the method, but <em>actual</em> argument promises
which have been forced retain the values found when they were forced. 
On the other hand, missing arguments have values which are promises to
use the default supplied by the method and not by the generic.)  If the
method found is a primitive it is called with the matched argument list
of promises (possibly already forced) used for the generic.

   <p><a name="index-builtin-function-55"></a><a name="index-special-function-56"></a><a name="index-primitive-function-57"></a><a name="index-g_t_002eInternal-function-58"></a>The essential difference<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a> between special and builtin functions is
that the arguments of specials are not evaluated before the C code is
called, and those of builtins are.  Note that being a special/builtin is
separate from being primitive or <code>.Internal</code>: <code>quote</code> is a
special primitive, <code>+</code> is a builtin primitive, <code>cbind</code> is a
special <code>.Internal</code> and <code>grep</code> is a builtin <code>.Internal</code>.

   <p><a name="index-generic_002c-internal-59"></a><a name="index-DispatchOrEval-60"></a>Many of the internal functions are internal generics, which for specials
means that they do not evaluate their arguments on call, but the C code
starts with a call to <code>DispatchOrEval</code>.  The latter evaluates the
first argument, and looks for a method based on its class.  (If S4
dispatch is on, S4 methods are looked for first, even for S3 classes.) 
If it finds a method, it dispatches to that method with a call based on
promises to evaluate the remaining arguments.  If no method is found,
the remaining arguments are evaluated before return to the internal
generic.

   <p><a name="index-generic_002c-generic-61"></a><a name="index-DispatchGeneric-62"></a>The other way that internal functions can be generic is to be group
generic.  Most such functions are builtins (so immediately evaluate all
their arguments), and all contain a call to the C function
<code>DispatchGeneric</code>.  There are some peculiarities over the number of
arguments for the <code>"Math"</code> group generic, with some members
allowing only one argument, some having two (with a default for the
second) and <code>trunc</code> allows one or more but the default method only
accepts one.

<h4 class="subsection">1.5.1 Missingness</h4>

<p><a name="index-missingness-63"></a>Actual arguments to (non-internal) R functions can be fewer than are
required to match the formal arguments of the function.  Having
unmatched formal arguments will not matter if the argument is never used
(by lazy evaluation),  but when the argument is evaluated, either its
default value is evaluated (within the evaluation environment of the
function) or an error is thrown with a message along the lines of

<pre class="example">     argument "foobar" is missing, with no default
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-MISSING-64"></a><a name="index-R_005fMissingArg-65"></a>Internally missingness is handled by two mechanisms. The object
<code>R_MissingArg</code> is used to indicate that a formal argument has no
(default) value.  When matching the actual arguments to the formal
arguments, a new argument list is constructed from the formals all of
whose values are <code>R_MissingArg</code> with the first <code>MISSING</code> bit
set.  Then whenever a formal argument is matched to an actual argument,
the corresponding member of the new argument list has its value set to
that of the matched actual argument, and if that is not
<code>R_MissingArg</code> the missing bit is unset.

   <p>This new argument list is used to form the evaluation frame for the
function, and if named arguments are subsequently given a new value
(before they are evaluated) the missing bit is cleared.

   <p>Missingness of arguments can be interrogated via the <code>missing()</code>
function.  An argument is clearly missing if its missing bit is set or
if the value is <code>R_MissingArg</code>.  However, missingness can be passed
on from function to function, for using a formal argument as an actual
argument in a function call does not count as evaluation.  So
<code>missing()</code> has to examine the value (a promise) of a
non-yet-evaluated formal argument to see if it might be missing, which
might involve investigating a promise and so on <small class="dots">...</small>.

   <p>Special primitives also need to handle missing arguments, and in some
case (e.g. <code>log</code>) that is why they are special and not
builtin.  This is usually done by testing if an argument's value is
<code>R_MissingArg</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">1.5.2 Dot-dot-dot arguments</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002e_002e_002e-argument-66"></a>Dot-dot-dot arguments are convenient when writing functions, but
complicate the internal code for argument evaluation.

   <p>The formals of a function with a <code>...</code> argument represent that as a
single argument like any other argument, with tag the symbol
<code>R_DotsSymbol</code>.  When the actual arguments are matched to the
formals, the value of the <code>...</code> argument is of <code>SEXPTYPE</code>
<code>DOTSXP</code>, a pairlist of promises (as used for matched arguments)
but distinguished by the <code>SEXPTYPE</code>.

   <p>Recall that the evaluation frame for a function initially contains the
<var>name</var><code>=</code><var>value</var> pairs from the matched call, and hence
this will be true for <code>...</code> as well.  The value of <code>...</code> is a
(special) pairlist whose elements are referred to by the special symbols
<code>..1</code>, <code>..2</code>, <small class="dots">...</small> which have the <code>DDVAL</code> bit set:
when one of these is encountered it is looked up (via <code>ddfindVar</code>)
in the value of the <code>...</code> symbol in the evaluation frame.

   <p>Values of arguments matched to a <code>...</code> argument can be missing.

   <p>Special primitives may need to handle <code>...</code> arguments: see for
example the internal code of <code>switch</code> in file
<samp><span class="file">src/main/builtin.c</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">1.6 Autoprinting</h3>

<p><a name="index-autoprinting-67"></a><a name="index-R_005fVisible-68"></a>
Whether the returned value of a top-level R expression is printed is
controlled by the global boolean variable <code>R_Visible</code>.  This is set
(to true or false) on entry to all primitive and internal functions
based on the <code>eval</code> column of the table in file
<samp><span class="file">src/main/names.c</span></samp>: the appropriate setting can be extracted by the
macro <code>PRIMPRINT</code>. 
<a name="index-PRIMPRINT-69"></a>
<a name="index-invisible-70"></a>The R primitive function <code>invisible</code> makes use of this
mechanism: it just sets <code>R_Visible = FALSE</code> before entry and
returns its argument.

   <p>For most functions the intention will be that the setting of
<code>R_Visible</code> when they are entered is the setting used when they
return, but there need to be exceptions.  The R functions
<code>identify</code>, <code>options</code>, <code>system</code> and <code>writeBin</code>
determine whether the result should be visible from the arguments or
user action.  Other functions themselves dispatch functions which may
change the visibility flag: examples<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a> are
<code>.Internal</code>, <code>do.call</code>, <code>eval</code>, <code>withVisible</code>,
<code>if</code>, <code>NextMethod</code>, <code>Recall</code>, <code>recordGraphics</code>,
<code>standardGeneric</code>, <code>switch</code> and <code>UseMethod</code>.

   <p>‘Special’ primitive and internal functions evaluate their arguments
internally <em>after</em> <code>R_Visible</code> has been set, and evaluation of
the arguments (e.g. an assignment as in PR#9263)) can change the value
of the flag.  Prior to R 2.5.0, known instances of such functions
reset the flag after the internal evaluation of arguments: examples
include <code>[</code>, <code>[[</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>cbind</code>,
<code>dump</code>, <code>rbind</code> and <code>unlist</code>, as well as the language
constructs (which are primitives) <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> and
<code>repeat</code>.

   <p>The <code>R_Visible</code> flag can also get altered during the evaluation of
a function, with comments in the code about <code>warning</code>,
<code>writeChar</code> and graphics functions calling <code>GText</code> (PR#7397). 
(Since the C-level function <code>eval</code> sets <code>R_Visible</code>, this
could apply to any function calling it.  Since it is called when
evaluating promises, even object lookup can change <code>R_Visible</code>.) 
As from R 2.5.0 internal and primitive functions force the documented
setting of <code>R_Visible</code> on return, unless the C code is allowed to
change it (the exceptions above are indicated by <code>PRIMPRINT</code> having
value 2).

   <p>The actual autoprinting is done by <code>PrintValueEnv</code> in file
<samp><span class="file">print.c</span></samp>.  If the object to be printed has the S4 bit set and S4
methods dispatch is on, <code>show</code> is called to print the object. 
Otherwise, if the object bit is set (so the object has a
<code>"class"</code> attribute), <code>print</code> is called to dispatch methods:
for objects without a class the internal code of <code>print.default</code>
is called.

<h3 class="section">1.7 The write barrier and the garbage collector</h3>

<p><a name="index-write-barrier-71"></a><a name="index-garbage-collector-72"></a>R has since version 1.2.0 had a generational garbage collector, and
bit <code>gcgen</code> in the <code>sxpinfo</code> header is used in the
implementation of this.  This is used in conjunction with the
<code>mark</code> bit to identify two previous generations.

   <p>There are three levels of collections.  Level 0 collects only the
youngest generation, level 1 collects the two youngest generations and
level 2 collects all generations.  After 20 level-0 collections the next
collection is at level 1, and after 5 level-1 collections at level 2. 
Further, if a level-<var>n</var> collection fails to provide 20% free space
(for each of nodes and the vector heap), the next collection will be at
level <var>n+1</var>.  (The R-level function <code>gc()</code> performs a
level-2 collection.)

   <p>A generational collector needs to efficiently ‘age’ the objects,
especially list-like objects (including <code>STRSXP</code>s).  This is done
by ensuring that the elements of a list are regarded as at least as old
as the list <em>when they are assigned</em>.  This is handled by the
functions <code>SET_VECTOR_ELT</code> and <code>SET_STRING_ELT</code>, which is why
they are functions and not macros.  Ensuring the integrity of such
operations is termed the <dfn>write barrier</dfn> and is done by making the
<code>SEXP</code> opaque and only providing access via functions (which cannot
be used as lvalues in assignments in C).

   <p>All code in R extensions is by default behind the write barrier.  The
only way to obtain direct access to the internals of the <code>SEXPREC</code>s
is to define ‘<samp><span class="samp">USE_RINTERNALS</span></samp>’ before including header file
<samp><span class="file">Rinternals.h</span></samp>, which is normally defined in <samp><span class="file">Defn.h</span></samp>.  To
enable a check on the way that the access is used, R can be compiled
with flag <samp><span class="option">--enable-strict-barrier</span></samp> which ensures that header
<samp><span class="file">Defn.h</span></samp> does not define ‘<samp><span class="samp">USE_RINTERNALS</span></samp>’ and hence that
<code>SEXP</code> is opaque in most of R itself.  (There are some necessary
exceptions: foremost in file <samp><span class="file">memory.c</span></samp> where the accessor
functions are defined and also in file <samp><span class="file">size.c</span></samp> which needs access
to the sizes of the internal structures.)

<h3 class="section">1.8 Serialization Formats</h3>

<p><a name="index-serialization-73"></a>Serialized versions of R objects are used by <code>load</code>/<code>save</code>
and also at a slightly lower level by <code>saveRDS</code>/<code>readRDS</code> (and
their earlier ‘internal’ dot-name versions) and
<code>serialize</code>/<code>unserialize</code>.  These differ in what they
serialize to (a file, a connection, a raw vector) and whether they are
intended to serialize a single object or a collection of objects
(typically the workspace).  <code>save</code> writes a header at the beginning
of the file (a single LF-terminated line) which the lower-level versions
do not.

   <p><code>save</code> and <code>saveRDS</code> allow various forms of compression, and
<samp><span class="command">gzip</span></samp> compression has been the default (except for ASCII saves)
since R 2.4.0.  Compression is applied to the whole file stream,
including the headers, so serialized files can be uncompressed or
re-compressed by external programs.  Since R 2.10.0 both <code>load</code>
and <code>readRDS</code> can read <samp><span class="command">gzip</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">bzip2</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">xz</span></samp> forms of compression when reading from a file, and
<samp><span class="command">gzip</span></samp> compression when reading from a connection.

   <p>R has used the same serialization format since R 1.4.0 in December
2001.  Earlier formats are still supported via <code>load</code> and
<code>save</code> but such formats are not described here. The current
serialization format is called ‘version 2’, and has been expanded in
back-compatible ways since R 1.4.0, for example to support additional
<code>SEXPTYPE</code>s.

   <p><code>save</code> works by writing a single-line header (typically
<code>RDX2\n</code> for a binary save: the only other current value is
<code>RDA2\n</code> for <code>save(files=TRUE)</code>), then creating a tagged
pairlist of the objects to be saved and serializing that single object. 
<code>load</code> reads the header line, unserializes a single object (a
pairlist or a vector list) and assigns the elements of the object in the
specified environment.  The header line serves two purposes in R: it
identifies the serialization format so <code>load</code> can switch to the
appropriate reader code, and the linefeed allows the detection of files
which have been subjected to a non-binary transfer which re-mapped line
endings.  It can also be thought of as a ‘magic number’ in the sense
used by the <samp><span class="command">file</span></samp> program (although R save files are not yet
by default known to that program).

   <p>Serialization in R needs to take into account that objects may
contain references to environments, which then have enclosing
environments and so on.  (Environments recognized as package or name
space environments are saved by name.)  There are ‘reference objects’
which are not duplicated on copy and should remain shared on
unserialization.  These are weak references, external pointers and
environments other than those associated with packages, namespaces and
the global environment.  These are handled via a hash table, and
references after the first are written out as a reference marker indexed
by the table entry.

   <p>Version-2 serialization first writes a header indicating the format
(normally ‘<samp><span class="samp">X\n</span></samp>’ for an XDR format binary save, but ‘<samp><span class="samp">A\n</span></samp>’,
ASCII, and ‘<samp><span class="samp">B\n</span></samp>’, native word-order binary, can also occur) and
then three integers giving the version of the format and two R
versions (packed by the <code>R_Version</code> macro from <samp><span class="file">Rversion.h</span></samp>). 
(Unserialization interprets the two versions as the version of R
which wrote the file followed by the minimal version of R needed to
read the format.)  Serialization then writes out the object recursively
using function <code>WriteItem</code> in file <samp><span class="file">src/main/serialize.c</span></samp>.

   <p>Some objects are written as if they were <code>SEXPTYPE</code>s: such
pseudo-<code>SEXPTYPE</code>s cover <code>R_NilValue</code>, <code>R_EmptyEnv</code>,
<code>R_BaseEnv</code>, <code>R_GlobalEnv</code>, <code>R_UnboundValue</code>,
<code>R_MissingArg</code> and <code>R_BaseNamespace</code>.

   <p>For all <code>SEXPTYPE</code>s except <code>NILSXP</code>, <code>SYMSXP</code> and
<code>ENVSXP</code> serialization starts with an integer with the
<code>SEXPTYPE</code> in bits 0:7<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a> followed by the object bit, two bits
indicating if there are any attributes and if there is a tag (for the
pairlist types), an unused bit and then the <code>gp</code>
field<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a> in
bits 12:27.  Pairlist-like objects write their attributes (if any), tag
(if any), CAR and then CDR (using tail recursion): other objects write
their attributes after themselves.  Atomic vector objects write their
length followed by the data: generic vector-list objects write their
length followed by a call to <code>WriteItem</code> for each element.  The
code for <code>CHARSXP</code>s special-cases <code>NA_STRING</code> and writes it as
length <code>-1</code> with no data.

   <p>Environments are treated in several ways: as we have seen, some are
written as specific pseudo-<code>SEXPTYPE</code>s.  Package and namespace
environments are written with pseudo-<code>SEXPTYPE</code>s followed by the
name.  ‘Normal’ environments are written out as <code>ENVSXP</code>s with an
integer indicating if the environment is locked followed by the
enclosure, frame, ‘tag’ (the hash table) and attributes.

   <p>In the ‘XDR’ format integers and doubles are written in bigendian order:
however the format is not fully XDR (as defined in RFC 1832) as byte
quantities (such as the contents of <code>CHARSXP</code> and <code>RAWSXP</code>
types) are written as-is and not padded to a multiple of four bytes.

   <p>The ‘ASCII’ format writes 7-bit characters.  Integers are formatted with
<code>%d</code> (except that <code>NA_integer_</code> is written as <code>NA</code>),
doubles formatted with <code>%.16g</code> (plus <code>NA</code>, <code>Inf</code> and
<code>-Inf</code>) and bytes with <code>%02x</code>.  Strings are written using
standard escapes (e.g. <code>\t</code> and <code>\013</code>) for non-printing and
non-ASCII bytes.

<p>Character data in R are stored in the sexptype <code>CHARSXP</code>.  Until
R 2.1.0 it was assumed that the data were in the platform's native
8-bit encoding, and furthermore it was quite often assumed that the
encoding was ISO Latin-1 or a near-superset (such as Windows' CP1252 or
Latin-9).

   <p>As from R 2.1.0 there was support for other encodings, in particular
UTF-8 and the multi-byte encodings used on Windows for CJK languages. 
However, there was no way of indicating which encoding had been used,
even if this was known (and e.g. <code>scan</code> would not know the
encoding of the file it was reading).  This lead to packages with data
in French encoded in Latin-1 in <code>.rda</code> files which could not be
read in other locales (and they would be able to be displayed in a
French UTF-8 locale, if not in non-UTF-8 Japanese locales).

   <p>R 2.5.0 introduced a limited means to indicate the encoding of a
<code>CHARSXP</code> via two of the ‘general purpose’ bits which are used to
declare the encoding to be either Latin-1 or UTF-8.  (Note that it is
possible for a character vector to contain elements in different
encodings.)  Both printing and plotting notice the declaration and
convert the string to the current locale (possibly using <code>&lt;xx&gt;</code> to
display in hexadecimal bytes that are not valid in the current locale). 
Many (but not all) of the character manipulation functions will either
preserve the declaration or re-encode the character string.

   <p>Strings that refer to the OS such as file names need to be passed
through a wide-character interface on some OSes (e.g. Windows), which is
to a large extent done as from R 2.7.0.

   <p>When are character strings declared to be of known encoding?  One way is
to do so directly via <code>Encoding</code>.  The parser declares the encoding
if this is known, either via the <code>encoding</code> argument to
<code>parse</code> or from the locale within which parsing is being done at
the R command line.  (Other ways are recorded on the help page for
<code>Encoding</code>.)

   <p>It is not necessary to declare the encoding of ASCII strings as they
will work in any locale.  ASCII strings should never have a marked
encoding, as any encoding will be ignored when entering such strings
into the <code>CHARSXP</code> cache.

   <p>The rationale behind considering only UTF-8 and Latin-1 is that most
systems are capable of producing UTF-8 strings and this is the nearest
we have to a universal format.  For those that do not (for example those
lacking a powerful enough <code>iconv</code>), it is likely that they work in
Latin-1, the old R assumption.

   <p>This was taken further in R 2.7.0.  There the parser can return a
UTF-8-encoded string if it encounters a ‘<samp><span class="samp">\uxxx</span></samp>’ escape for a
Unicode point that cannot be represented in the current charset.  (This
needs MBCS support, and was only enabled<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-9" name="fnd-9"><sup>9</sup></a> on
Windows.)  From R 2.10.0 it is enabled for all platforms with MBCS
support, and a ‘<samp><span class="samp">\uxxx</span></samp>’ or ‘<samp><span class="samp">\Uxxxxxxxx</span></samp>’ escape ensures that the
parsed string will be marked as UTF-8.

   <p>Most of the character manipulation functions now preserve UTF-8
encodings: there are some notes as to which at the top of file
<samp><span class="file">src/main/character.c</span></samp> and in file
<samp><span class="file">src/library/base/man/Encoding.Rd</span></samp>.

   <p>Graphics devices are offered the possibility of handing UTF-8-encoded
strings without re-encoding to the native character set, by setting
<code>hasTextUTF8</code> to be ‘<samp><span class="samp">TRUE</span></samp>’ and supplying functions
<code>textUTF8</code> and <code>strWidthUTF8</code> that expect UTF-8-encoded
inputs.  Normally the symbol font is encoded in Adobe Symbol encoding,
but that can be re-encoded to UTF-8 by setting <code>wantSymbolUTF8</code> to
‘<samp><span class="samp">TRUE</span></samp>’.  The Windows' port of cairographics has a rather peculiar
assumption: it wants the symbol font to be encoded in UTF-8 as if it
were encoded in Latin-1 rather than Adobe Symbol: this is selected by
<code>wantSymbolUTF8 = NA_LOGICAL</code> (as from R 2.13.1).

   <p>Windows has no UTF-8 locales, but rather expects to work with
UCS-2<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-10" name="fnd-10"><sup>10</sup></a> strings. 
R (being written in standard C) would not work internally with UCS-2
without extensive changes.  The <samp><span class="file">Rgui</span></samp> console<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a> uses UCS-2 internally, but communicates with the R
engine in the native encoding.  To allow UTF-8 strings to be printed in
UTF-8 in <samp><span class="file">Rgui.exe</span></samp>, an escape convention is used (see header file
<samp><span class="file">rgui_UTF8.h</span></samp>) which is used by <code>cat</code>, <code>print</code> and
autoprinting.

   <p>‘Unicode’ (UCS-2LE) files are common in the Windows world, and
<code>readLines</code> and <code>scan</code> will read them into UTF-8 strings on
Windows if the encoding is declared explicitly on an unopened
connection passed to those functions.

<h3 class="section">1.10 The CHARSXP cache</h3>

<p><a name="index-mkChar-74"></a>A global cache for <code>CHARSXP</code>s created by <code>mkChar</code> was
introduced in R 2.6.0 &ndash; the cache ensures that most <code>CHARSXP</code>s
with the same contents share storage (‘contents’ including any declared
encoding).  Not all <code>CHARSXP</code>s are part of the cache &ndash; notably
‘<samp><span class="samp">NA_STRING</span></samp>’ is not. <code>CHARSXP</code>s reloaded from the <code>save</code>
formats of R prior to 0.99.0 are not cached (since the code used is
frozen and few examples still exist).

   <p><a name="index-mkCharLenCE-75"></a>The cache records the encoding of the string as well as the bytes: all
requests to create a <code>CHARSXP</code> should be <em>via</em> a call to
<code>mkCharLenCE</code>.  Any encoding given in <code>mkCharLenCE</code> call will
be ignored if the string's bytes are all ASCII characters.

<h3 class="section">1.11 Warnings and errors</h3>

<p><a name="index-warning-76"></a><a name="index-warningcall-77"></a><a name="index-error-78"></a><a name="index-errorcall-79"></a>
Each of <code>warning</code> and <code>stop</code> have two C-level equivalents,
<code>warning</code>, <code>warningcall</code>, <code>error</code> and <code>errorcall</code>. 
The relationship between the pairs is similar: <code>warning</code> tries to
fathom out a suitable call, and then calls <code>warningcall</code> with that
call as the first argument if it succeeds, and with <code>call =
R_NilValue</code> it is does not.  When <code>warningcall</code> is called, it
includes the deparsed call in its printout unless <code>call =
R_NilValue</code>.

   <p><code>warning</code> and <code>error</code> look at the context stack.  If the
topmost context is not of type <code>CTXT_BUILTIN</code>, it is used to
provide the call, otherwise the next context provides the call. 
This means that when these functions are called from a primitive or
<code>.Internal</code>, the imputed call will not be to
primitive/<code>.Internal</code> but to the function calling the
primitive/<code>.Internal</code> .  This is exactly what one wants for a
<code>.Internal</code>, as this will give the call to the closure wrapper. 
(Further, for a <code>.Internal</code>, the call is the argument to
<code>.Internal</code>, and so may not correspond to any R function.) 
However, it is unlikely to be what is needed for a primitive.

   <p>The upshot is that that <code>warningcall</code> and <code>errorcall</code> should
normally be used for code called from a primitive, and <code>warning</code>
and <code>error</code> should be used for code called from a <code>.Internal</code>
(and necessarily from <code>.Call</code>, <code>.C</code> and so on, where the call
is not passed down).  However, there are two complications.  One is that
code might be called from either a primitive or a <code>.Internal</code>, in
which case probably <code>warningcall</code> is more appropriate.  The other
involves replacement functions, where the call will be of the form
(from R &lt; 2.6.0)
<pre class="example">     &gt; length(x) &lt;- y ~ x
     Error in "length&lt;-"(`*tmp*`, value = y ~ x) : invalid value
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which is unpalatable to the end user.  For replacement functions there
will be a suitable context at the top of the stack, so <code>warning</code>
should be used.  (The results for <code>.Internal</code> replacement functions
such as <code>substr&lt;-</code> are not ideal.)

<h4 class="subsection">1.12.1 Representation of S4 objects</h4>

<p>S4 objects can be of any <code>SEXPTYPE</code>.  They are either an object of
a simple type (such as an atomic vector or function) with S4 class
information or of type <code>S4SXP</code>.  In all cases, the ‘S4 bit’ (bit 4
of the ‘general purpose’ field) is set, and can be tested by the
macro/function <code>IS_S4_OBJECT</code>.

   <p>S4 objects are created via <code>new()</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-12" name="fnd-12"><sup>12</sup></a> and thence via the C
function <code>R_do_new_object</code>.  This duplicates the prototype of the
class, adds a class attribute and sets the S4 bit.  All S4 class
attributes should be character vectors of length one with an attribute
giving (as a character string) the name of the package (or
<code>.GlobalEnv</code>) containing the class definition.  Since S4 objects
have a class attribute, the <code>OBJECT</code> bit is set.

   <p>It is currently unclear what should happen if the class attribute is
removed from an S4 object, or if this should be allowed.

<h4 class="subsection">1.12.2 S4 classes</h4>

<p>S4 classes are stored as R objects in the environment in which they
are created, with names <code>.__C__</code><var>classname</var>: as such they are
not listed by default by <code>ls</code>.

   <p>The objects are S4 objects of class <code>"classRepresentation"</code> which
is defined in the <strong>methods</strong> package.

   <p>Since these are just objects, they are subject to the normal scoping
rules and can be imported and exported from namespaces like other
objects.  The directives <code>importClassesFrom</code> and
<code>exportClasses</code> are merely convenient ways to refer to class
objects without needing to know their internal ‘metaname’ (although
<code>exportClasses</code> does a little sanity checking via <code>isClass</code>).

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.12.3 S4 methods</h4>

<p>Details of methods are stored in S4 objects of class
<code>"MethodsList"</code>.  They have a non-syntactic name of the form
<code>.__M__</code><var>generic</var><code>:</code><var>package</var> for all methods defined in the
current environment for the named generic derived from a specific
package (which might be <code>.GlobalEnv</code>).

   <p>There is also environment <code>.__T__</code><var>generic</var><code>:</code><var>package</var> which
has names the signatures of the methods defined, and values the
corresponding method functions.  This is often referred to as a `methods
table'.

   <p>When a package without a namespace is attached these objects become
visible on the search path.  <code>library</code> calls
<code>methods:::cacheMetaData</code> to update the internal tables.

   <p>During an R session there is an environment associated with each
non-primitive generic containing objects <code>.AllMTable</code>,
<code>.Generic</code>, <code>.Methods</code>, <code>.MTable</code>, <code>.SigArgs</code> and
<code>.SigLength</code>.  <code>.MTable</code> and <code>AllMTable</code> are merged
methods tables containing all the methods defined directly and via
inheritance respectively.  <code>.Methods</code> is a merged methods list.

   <p>Exporting methods from a namespace is more complicated than exporting a
class.  Note first that you do not export a method, but rather the
directive <code>exportMethods</code> will export all the methods defined in
the namespace for a specified generic: the code also adds to the list
of generics any that are exported directly.  For generics which are
listed via <code>exportMethods</code> or exported themselves, the
corresponding <code>"MethodsList"</code> and environment are exported and so
will appear (as hidden objects) in the package environment.

   <p>Methods for primitives which are internally S4 generic (see below) are
always exported, whether mentioned in the <samp><span class="file">NAMESPACE</span></samp> file or not.

   <p>Methods can be imported either via the directive
<code>importMethodsFrom</code> or via importing a namespace by <code>import</code>. 
Also, if a generic is imported via <code>importFrom</code>, its methods are
also imported.  In all cases the generic will be imported if it is in
the namespace, so <code>importMethodsFrom</code> is most appropriate for
methods defined on generics in other packages.  Since methods for a
generic could be imported from several different packages, the methods
tables are merged.

   <p>When a package with a namespace is attached
<code>methods:::cacheMetaData</code> is called to update the internal tables:
only the visible methods will be cached.

<h4 class="subsection">1.12.4 Mechanics of S4 dispatch</h4>

<p>This subsection does not discuss how S4 methods are chosen: see
<a href="http://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf">http://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf</a>.

   <p>For all but primitive functions, setting a method on an existing
function that is not itself S4 generic creates a new object in the
current environment which is a call to <code>standardGeneric</code> with the
old definition as the default method.  Such S4 generics can also be
created <em>via</em> a call to <code>setGeneric</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-13" name="fnd-13"><sup>13</sup></a> and are standard closures
in the R language, with environment the environment within which they
are created.  With the advent of namespaces this is somewhat
problematic: if <code>myfn</code> was previously in a package with a name
space there will be two functions called <code>myfn</code> on the search
paths, and which will be called depends on which search path is in use. 
This is starkest for functions in the base namespace, where the
original will be found ahead of the newly created function from any
other package with a namespace.

   <p>Primitive functions are treated quite differently, for efficiency
reasons: this results in different semantics.  <code>setGeneric</code> is
disallowed for primitive functions.  The <strong>methods</strong> namespace
contains a list <code>.BasicFunsList</code> named by primitive functions:
the entries are either <code>FALSE</code> or a standard S4 generic showing
the effective definition.  When <code>setMethod</code> (or
<code>setReplaceMethod</code>) is called, it either fails (if the list entry
is <code>FALSE</code>) or a method is set on the effective generic given in
the list.

   <p>Actual dispatch of S4 methods for almost all primitives piggy-backs on
the S3 dispatch mechanism, so S4 methods can only be dispatched for
primitives which are internally S3 generic.  When a primitive that is
internally S3 generic is called with a first argument which is an S4
object and S4 dispatch is on (that is, the <strong>methods</strong> namespace is
loaded), <code>DispatchOrEval</code> calls <code>R_possible_dispatch</code> (defined
in file <samp><span class="file">src/main/objects.c</span></samp>).  (Members of the S3 group generics,
which includes all the generic operators, are treated slightly
differently: the first two arguments are checked and
<code>DispatchGroup</code> is called.)  <code>R_possible_dispatch</code> first
checks an internal table to see if any S4 methods are set for that
generic (and S4 dispatch is currently enabled for that generic), and if
so proceeds to S4 dispatch using methods stored in another internal
table.  All primitives are in the base namespace, and this mechanism
means that S4 methods can be set for (some) primitives and will always
be used, in contrast to setting methods on non-primitives.

   <p>The exception is <code>%*%</code>, which is S4 generic but not S3 generic as
its C code contains a direct call to <code>R_possible_dispatch</code>.

   <p>The primitive <code>as.double</code> is special, as <code>as.numeric</code> and
<code>as.real</code> are copies of it.  The <strong>methods</strong> package code partly
refers to generics by name and partly by function, and maps
<code>as.double</code> and <code>as.real</code> to <code>as.numeric</code> (since that is
the name used by packages exporting methods for it).

   <p>Some elements of the language are implemented as primitives, for example
<code>}</code>.  This includes the subset and subassignment ‘functions’ and
they are S4 generic, again piggybacking on S3 dispatch.

   <p><code>.BasicFunsList</code> is generated when <strong>methods</strong> is installed, by
computing all primitives, initially disallowing methods on all and then
setting generics for members of <code>.GenericArgsEnv</code>, the S4 group
generics and a short exceptions list in file <samp><span class="file">BasicFunsList.R</span></samp>: this
currently contains the subsetting and subassignment operators and an
override for <code>c</code>.

<h3 class="section">1.13 Memory allocators</h3>

<p>R's memory allocation is almost all done via routines in file
<samp><span class="file">src/main/memory.c</span></samp>.  It is important to keep track of where memory
is allocated, as the Windows port (by default) makes use of a memory
allocator that differs from <code>malloc</code> etc as provided by MinGW. 
Specifically, there are entry points <code>Rm_malloc</code>, <code>Rm_free</code>,
<code>Rm_calloc</code> and <code>Rm_free</code> provided by file
<samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/malloc.c</span></samp>.  This was done for two reasons.  The
primary motivation was performance: the allocator provided by MSVCRT
<em>via</em> MinGW was far too slow at handling the many small allocations
that the allocation system for <code>SEXPREC</code>s uses.  As a side benefit,
we can set a limit on the amount of allocated memory: this is useful as
whereas Windows does provide virtual memory it is relatively far slower
than many other R platforms and so limiting R's use of swapping is
highly advantageous.  The high-performance allocator is only called from
<samp><span class="file">src/main/memory.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">src/main/regex.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">src/extra/pcre</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">src/extra/xdr</span></samp>: note that this means that it is not used in
packages.

   <p>The rest of R should where possible make use of the allocators made
available by file <samp><span class="file">src/main/memory.c</span></samp>, which are also the methods
recommended in
<a href="R-exts.html#Memory-allocation">Memory allocation</a>
<a name="index-R_005falloc-80"></a><a name="index-Calloc-81"></a><a name="index-Realloc-82"></a><a name="index-Free-83"></a>for use in R packages, namely the use of <code>R_alloc</code>,
<code>Calloc</code>, <code>Realloc</code> and <code>Free</code>.  Memory allocated by
<code>R_alloc</code> is freed by the garbage collector once the ‘watermark’
has been reset by calling
<a name="index-vmaxset-84"></a><code>vmaxset</code>.  This is done automatically by the wrapper code calling
primitives and <code>.Internal</code> functions (and also by the wrapper code
to <code>.Call</code> and <code>.External</code>), but
<a name="index-vmaxget-85"></a><code>vmaxget</code> and <code>vmaxset</code> can be used to reset the watermark
from within internal code if the memory is only required for a short
time.

   <p><a name="index-alloca-86"></a>All of the methods of memory allocation mentioned so far are relatively
expensive.  All R platforms support <code>alloca</code>, and in almost all
cases<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-14" name="fnd-14"><sup>14</sup></a> this is managed by the
compiler, allocates memory on the C stack and is very efficient.

   <p>There are two disadvantages in using <code>alloca</code>.  First, it is
fragile and care is needed to avoid writing (or even reading) outside
the bounds of the allocation block returned.  Second, it increases the
danger of overflowing the C stack.   It is suggested that it is only
used for smallish allocations (up to tens of thousands of bytes), and
that

   <p><a name="index-R_005fCheckStack-87"></a>
<pre class="example">         R_CheckStack();
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is called immediately after the allocation (as R's stack checking
mechanism will warn far enough from the stack limit to allow for modest
use of alloca).  (<code>do_makeunique</code> in file <samp><span class="file">src/main/unique.c</span></samp>
provides an example of both points.)

   <p>An alternative strategy has been used for various functions which
require intermediate blocks of storage of varying but usually small
size, and this has been consolidated into the routines in the header
file <samp><span class="file">src/main/RBufferUtils.h</span></samp>.  This uses a structure which
contains a buffer, the current size and the default size. A call to
<a name="index-R_005fAllocStringBuffer-88"></a>
<pre class="example">         R_AllocStringBuffer(size_t blen, R_StringBuffer *buf);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">sets <code>buf-&gt;data</code> to a memory area of at least <code>blen+1</code> bytes. 
At least the default size is used, which means that for small
allocations the same buffer can be reused.  A call to
<a name="index-R_005fFreeStringBufferL-89"></a><a name="index-R_005fFreeStringBuffer-90"></a><code>R_FreeStringBufferL</code> releases memory if more than the default has
been allocated whereas a call to <code>R_FreeStringBuffer</code> frees any
memory allocated.

   <p>The <code>R_StringBuffer</code> structure needs to be initialized, for example by

<pre class="example">     static R_StringBuffer ex_buff = {NULL, 0, MAXELTSIZE};
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which uses a default size of <code>MAXELTSIZE = 8192</code> bytes.  Most
current uses have a static <code>R_StringBuffer</code> structure, which
allows the (default-sized) buffer to be shared between calls to e.g. 
<code>grep</code> and even between functions: this will need to be changed if
R ever allows concurrent evaluation threads.  So the idiom is

<pre class="example">     static R_StringBuffer ex_buff = {NULL, 0, MAXELTSIZE};
     ...
         char *buf;
         for(i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
             compute len
             buf = R_AllocStringBuffer(len, &amp;ex_buff);
             use buf
         }
         /*  free allocation if larger than the default, but leave
             default allocated for future use */
        R_FreeStringBufferL(&amp;ex_buff);

<h4 class="subsection">1.13.1 Internals of R_alloc</h4>

<p>The memory used by <code>R_alloc</code> is allocated as R vectors, of type
<code>RAWSXP</code> for ‘small’ allocations (less than 2^31 - 1 bytes) and of
type <code>REALSXP</code> for allocations up to 2^34 - 1 bytes on 64-bit
machines.  Thus the allocation is in units of 8 bytes, and is rounded
up.  A request for zero bytes currently returns <code>NULL</code> (but
this should not be relied on).  For historical reasons, in all other
cases 1 byte is added before rounding up so the allocation is always
1&ndash;8 bytes more than was asked for: again this should not be relied on.

   <p>The vectors allocated are protected via the setting of <code>R_VStack</code>,
as the garbage collector marks everything that can be reached from that
location.  When a vector is <code>R_alloc</code>ated, its <code>ATTRIB</code>
pointer is set to the current <code>R_VStack</code>, and <code>R_VStack</code> is
set to the latest allocation.  Thus <code>R_VStack</code> is a single-linked
chain of the vectors currently allocated via <code>R_alloc</code>.  Function
<code>vmaxset</code> resets the location <code>R_VStack</code>, and should be to a
value that has previously be obtained <em>via</em> <code>vmaxget</code>:
allocations after the value was obtained will no longer be protected and
hence available for garbage collection.

<p><a name="index-modules-104"></a>R makes use of a number of shared objects/DLLs stored in the

chosen to be loaded ‘on demand’ rather than linked as dynamic libraries
or incorporated into the main executable/dynamic library.

   <p>For a few of these (e.g. <code>vfonts</code>) the issue is size: the
database for the Hershey fonts is included in the C code of the module
and was at one time an appreciable part of the codebase for a rarely
used feature.  However, for most of the modules the motivation has been
the amount of (often optional) code they will bring in via libraries to
which they are linked.

system-specific support libraries.

<h4 class="subsection">1.16.1 Hiding C entry points</h4>

<p>We make use of the visibility mechanisms discussed in
<a href="R-exts.html#Controlling-visibility">Controlling visibility</a>,
C entry points not needed outside the main R executable/dynamic
library (and in particular in no package nor module) should be prefixed
by <code>attribute_hidden</code>. 
<a name="index-attribute_005fhidden-106"></a>Minimizing the visibility of symbols in the R dynamic library will
speed up linking to it (which packages will do) and reduce the
possibility of linking to the wrong entry points of the same name.  In
addition, on some platforms reducing the number of entry points allows
more efficient versions of PIC to be used: somewhat over half the entry
points are hidden.  A convenient way to hide variables (as distinct from
functions) is to declare them <code>extern0</code> in header file <samp><span class="file">Defn.h</span></samp>.

   <p>The visibility mechanism used is only available with some compilers and
platforms, and in particular not on Windows, where an alternative
mechanism is used.  Entry points will not be made available in
<samp><span class="file">R.dll</span></samp> if they are listed in the file
<samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/Rdll.hide</span></samp>. 
<a name="index-Rdll_002ehide-107"></a>Entries in that file start with a space and must be strictly in
alphabetic order in the C locale (use <samp><span class="command">sort</span></samp> on the file to
ensure this if you change it).  It is possible to hide Fortran as well
as C entry points via this file: the former are lower-cased and have an
underline as suffix, and the suffixed name should be included in the
file.  Some entry points exist only on Windows or need to be visible
only on Windows, and some notes on these are provided in file
<samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/Maintainters.notes</span></samp>.

   <p>Because of the advantages of reducing the number of visible entry
points, they should be declared <code>attribute_hidden</code> where possible. 
Note that this only has an effect on a shared-R-library build, and so
care is needed not to hide entry points that are legitimately used by
packages.  So it is best if the decision on visibility is made when a
new entry point is created, including the decision if it should be
included in header file <samp><span class="file">Rinternals.h</span></samp>.  A list of the visible
entry points on shared-R-library build on a reasonably standard
Unix-alike can be made by something like

<pre class="example">     nm -g libR.so | grep ‘ [BCDT] ’ | cut -b20-

<h4 class="subsection">1.16.2 Variables in Windows DLLs</h4>

<p>Windows is unique in that it conventionally treats importing variables
differently from functions: variables that are imported from a DLL need
to be specified  by a prefix (often ‘<samp><span class="samp">_imp_</span></samp>’) when being linked to
(‘imported’) but not when being linked from (‘exported’).  The details
depend on the compiler system, and have changed for MinGW during the
lifetime of that port.  They are in the main hidden behind some macros
defined in header file <samp><span class="file">R_ext/libextern.h</span></samp>.

   <p>A (non-function) variable in the main R sources that needs to be
referred to outside <samp><span class="file">R.dll</span></samp> (in a package, module or another DLL
such as <samp><span class="file">Rgraphapp.dll</span></samp>) should be declared with prefix
<code>LibExtern</code>.  The main use is in <samp><span class="file">Rinternals.h</span></samp>, but it needs
to be considered for any public header and also <samp><span class="file">Defn.h</span></samp>.

   <p>It would nowadays be possible to make use of the ‘auto-import’ feature
of the MinGW port of <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> to fix up imports from DLLs (and if
R is built for the Cygwin platform this is what happens).  However,
this was not possible when the MinGW build of R was first constructed
in ca 1998, allows less control of visibility and would not work for
other Windows compiler suites.

   <p>It is only possible to check if this has been handled correctly by
compiling the R sources on Windows.

<h3 class="section">1.17 Lazy loading</h3>

<p>Lazy loading was introduced in R 2.0.0, for code in packages and for
datasets in packages (the latter is still optional, but code is always
lazy-loaded as from R 2.14.0).  When a package/namespace which uses it
is loaded, the package/namespace environment is populated with promises
for all the named objects: when these promises are evaluated they load
the actual code from a database.

   <p>There are separate databases for code and data, stored in the <samp><span class="file">R</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">data</span></samp> subdirectories.  The database consists of two files,
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.rdb</span></samp> and <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.rdx</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="file">.rdb</span></samp> file
is a concatenation of serialized objects, and the <samp><span class="file">.rdx</span></samp> file
contains an index.  The objects are stored in (usually) a
<samp><span class="command">gzip</span></samp>-compressed format with a 4-byte header giving the
uncompressed serialized length (in XDR, that is big-endian, byte order)
and read by a call to the primitive <code>lazyLoadDBfetch</code>.  (Note that
this makes lazy-loading unsuitable for really large objects: the
unserialized length of an R object can exceed 4GB.)

   <p>The index or ‘map’ file <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.rdx</span></samp> is a compressed serialized
R object to be read by <code>readRDS</code>.  It is a list with three
elements <code>variables</code>, <code>references</code> and <code>compressed</code>.  The
first two are named lists of integer vectors of length 2 giving the
offset and length of the serialized object in the <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.rdb</span></samp>
file.  Element <code>variables</code> has an entry for each named object:
<code>references</code> serializes a temporary environment used when named
environments are added to the database.  <code>compressed</code> is a logical
indicating if the serialized objects were compressed: compression is
always used nowadays. R 2.10.0 added the values <code>compressed = 2</code>
and <code>3</code> for <samp><span class="command">bzip2</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">xz</span></samp> compression (with the
possibility of future expansion to other methods): these formats add a
fifth byte to the header for the type of compression, and stores
serialized objects uncompressed if compression expands them.

   <p>The loader for a lazy-load database of code or data is function
<code>lazyLoad</code> in the <strong>base</strong> package, but note that there is a
separate copy to load <strong>base</strong> itself in file
<samp><span class="file">R_HOME/base/R/base</span></samp>.

   <p>Lazy-load databases are created by the code in
<samp><span class="file">src/library/tools/R/makeLazyLoad.R</span></samp>: the main tool is the
unexported function <code>makeLazyLoadDB</code> and the insertion of database
entries is done by calls to <code>.Call("R_lazyLoadDBinsertValue",
...)</code>.

   <p>Lazy-load databases of less than 10MB are cached in memory at first use:
this was found necessary when using file systems with high latency
(removable devices and network-mounted file systems on Windows).

   <p>The same database mechanism is used to store parsed <samp><span class="file">Rd</span></samp> files. 
One or all of the parsed objects is fetched by a call to
<code>tools:::fetchRdDB</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 <code>.Internal</code> vs <code>.Primitive</code></h2>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002eInternal-108"></a><a name="index-g_t_002ePrimitive-109"></a>C code compiled into R at build time can be called directly in what
are termed <em>primitives</em> or via the <code>.Internal</code> interface,
which is very similar to the <code>.External</code> interface except in
syntax.  More precisely, R maintains a table of R function names and
corresponding C functions to call, which by convention all start with
‘<samp><span class="samp">do_</span></samp>’ and return a <code>SEXP</code>.  This table (<code>R_FunTab</code> in
file <samp><span class="file">src/main/names.c</span></samp>) also specifies how many arguments to a
function are required or allowed, whether or not the arguments are to be
evaluated before calling, and whether the function is ‘internal’ in
the sense that it must be accessed via the <code>.Internal</code> interface,
or directly accessible in which case it is printed in R as
<code>.Primitive</code>.

   <p>Functions using <code>.Internal()</code> wrapped in a closure are in general
preferred as this ensures standard handling of named and default
arguments.  For example, <code>axis</code> is defined as

<pre class="example">     axis &lt;- function (side, at = NULL, labels = TRUE, tick = TRUE, line = NA,
         pos = NA, outer = FALSE, font = NA, lty = "solid", lwd = 1,
         lwd.ticks = lwd, col = NULL, col.ticks = NULL, hadj = NA,
         padj = NA, ...)
     {
         if (is.null(col) &amp;&amp; length(list(...)) &amp;&amp; !is.null(fg &lt;- list(...)$fg))
             col &lt;- fg
         .Internal(axis(side, at, as.graphicsAnnot(labels), tick,
             line, pos, outer, font, lty, lwd, lwd.ticks, col, col.ticks,
             hadj, padj, ...))
     }
</pre>
   <p>However, for reasons of convenience and also efficiency (as there is
some overhead in using the <code>.Internal</code> interface wrapped in a
function closure), the primitive functions are exceptions that can be
accessed directly.  And of course, primitive functions are needed for
basic operations&mdash;for example <code>.Internal</code> is itself a primitive. 
Note that primitive functions make no use of R code, and hence are
very different from the usual interpreted functions.  In particular,
<code>formals</code> and <code>body</code> return <code>NULL</code> for such objects, and
argument matching can be handled differently.  For some primitives
(including <code>call</code>, <code>switch</code>, <code>.C</code> and <code>.subset</code>)
positional matching is important to avoid partial matching of the first
argument.

   <p>The list of primitive functions is subject to change; currently, it
includes the following.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>&ldquo;Special functions&rdquo; which really are <em>language</em> elements, but
implemented as primitive functions:

     <pre class="example">          {       (         if     for      while  repeat  break  next
          return  function  quote  switch
     </pre>
     <li>Language elements and basic <em>operator</em>s (i.e., functions usually
<em>not</em> called as <code>foo(a, b, ...)</code>) for subsetting, assignment,
arithmetic and logic:

     <pre class="example">                         [    [[    $    @
          &lt;-   &lt;&lt;-  =    [&lt;-  [[&lt;-  $&lt;-
          
          +    -    *    /     ^    %%   %*%  %/%
          &lt;    &lt;=   ==   !=    &gt;=   &gt;
          |    ||   &amp;    &amp;&amp;    !
     </pre>
     <li>&ldquo;Low level&rdquo; 0&ndash; and 1&ndash;argument functions which belong to one of the
following groups of functions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Basic mathematical functions with a single argument, i.e.,

          <pre class="example">               abs     sign    sqrt
               floor   ceiling
               
               exp     expm1
               log2    log10   log1p
               cos     sin     tan
               acos    asin    atan
               cosh    sinh    tanh
               acosh   asinh   atanh
               
               gamma   lgamma  digamma trigamma
               
               cumsum  cumprod cummax  cummin
               
               Im  Re  Arg  Conj  Mod
          </pre>
          <p><code>log</code> is a primitive function of one or two arguments with named
argument matching.

          <p><code>trunc</code> is a difficult case: it is a primitive that can have one
or more arguments: the default method handled in the primitive has
only one.

          <li>Functions rarely used outside of &ldquo;programming&rdquo; (i.e., mostly used
inside other functions), such as

          <pre class="example">               nargs          missing        on.exit        interactive
               as.call        as.character   as.complex     as.double
               as.environment as.integer     as.logical     as.raw
               is.array       is.atomic      is.call        is.character
               is.complex     is.double      is.environment is.expression
               is.finite      is.function    is.infinite    is.integer
               is.language    is.list        is.logical     is.matrix
               is.na          is.name        is.nan         is.null
               is.numeric     is.object      is.pairlist    is.raw
               is.real        is.recursive   is.single      is.symbol
               baseenv        emptyenv       globalenv      pos.to.env
               unclass        invisible      seq_along      seq_len
          </pre>
          <li>The programming and session management utilities

          <pre class="example">               browser  proc.time  gc.time tracemem retracemem untracemem
          </pre>
          </ol>

     <li>The following basic replacement and extractor functions

     <pre class="example">          length      length&lt;-
          class       class&lt;-
          oldClass    oldCLass&lt;-

                      environment&lt;-
                      levels&lt;-
                      storage.mode&lt;-
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-NAMED-110"></a>Note that optimizing <code>NAMED = 1</code> is only effective within a
primitive (as the closure wrapper of a <code>.Internal</code> will set
<code>NAMED = 2</code> when the promise to the argument is evaluated) and
hence replacement functions should where possible be primitive to avoid
copying (at least in their default methods).

     <li>The following functions are primitive for efficiency reasons:

     <pre class="example">          :          ~          c           list
          call       expression substitute
          UseMethod  standardGeneric
          .C         .Fortran   .Call       .External
          round      signif      rep        seq.int
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">as well as the following internal-use-only functions

     <pre class="example">          .Primitive     .Internal
          .Call.graphics .External.graphics
          .subset        .subset2
          .primTrace     .primUntrace
          lazyLoadDBfetch
     </pre>
        </ol>

   <p>The multi-argument primitives
<pre class="example">     call       switch
     .C         .Fortran   .Call       .External
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">intentionally use positional matching, and need to do so to avoid
partial matching to their first argument.  They do check that the first
argument (partially) matched the formal argument name.  On the other
hand,

<pre class="example">     attr       attr&lt;-     browser     rememtrace substitute  UseMethod
     log        round      signif      rep        seq.int
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">manage their own argument matching and do work in the standard way.

   <p>All the one-argument primitives check that if they are called with a
named argument that this (partially) matches the name given in the
documentation: this is also done for replacement functions with one
argument plus <code>value</code>.

   <p>The net effect is that from R 2.11.0 argument matching for primitives
intended for end-user use is done in the same way as for interpreted
functions except for the six exceptions where positional matching is

<h3 class="section">2.1 Special primitives</h3>

<p>A small number of primitives are <em>specials</em> rather than
<em>builtins</em>, that is they are entered with unevaluated arguments. 
This is clearly necessary for the language constructs and the assignment
operators, as well as for <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> which conditionally
evaluate their second argument, and <code>~</code>, <code>.Internal</code>,
<code>call</code>, <code>expression</code>, <code>missing</code>, <code>on.exit</code>,
<code>quote</code> and <code>substitute</code> which do not evaluate some of their
arguments.

   <p><code>rep</code> and <code>seq.int</code> are special as they evaluate some of their
arguments conditional on which are non-missing.

   <p><code>log</code>, <code>round</code> and <code>signif</code> are special to allow default
values to be given to missing arguments.

   <p>The subsetting, subassignment and <code>@</code> operators are all special. 
(For both extraction and replacement forms, <code>$</code> and <code>@</code>
take a symbol argument, and <code>[</code> and <code>[[</code> allow missing
arguments.)

   <p><code>UseMethod</code> is special to avoid the additional contexts added to
calls to builtins.

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Prototypes for primitives</h3>

<p>Prototypes are available for the primitive functions and operators, and
these are used for printing, <code>args</code> and package checking (e.g. by
<code>tools::checkS3methods</code> and by package <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=codetools"><strong>codetools</strong></a>).  There are
two environments in the <strong>base</strong> package (and namespace),
‘<samp><span class="samp">.GenericArgsEnv</span></samp>’ for those primitives which are internal S3
generics, and ‘<samp><span class="samp">.ArgsEnv</span></samp>’ for the rest.  Those environments contain
closures with the same names as the primitives, formal arguments derived
(manually) from the help pages, a body which is a suitable call to
<code>UseMethod</code> or <code>NULL</code> and environment the base namespace.

   <p>The C code for <code>print.default</code> and <code>args</code> uses the closures in
these environments in preference to the definitions in base (as
primitives).

   <p>The QC function <code>undoc</code> checks that all the functions prototyped in
these environments are currently primitive, and that the primitives not
included are better thought of as language elements (at the time of
writing

<pre class="example">     $  $&lt;-  &amp;&amp;  (  :  @  [  [[  [[&lt;-  [&lt;-  {  ||  ~  &lt;-  &lt;&lt;-  =
     break  for function  if  next  repeat  return  while
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">).  One could argue about <code>~</code>, but it is known to the parser and has
semantics quite unlike a normal function.  And <code>:</code> is documented
with different argument names in its two meanings.)

   <p>The QC functions <code>codoc</code> and <code>checkS3methods</code> also make use of
these environments (effectively placing them in front of base in the
search path), and hence the formals of the functions they contain are
checked against the help pages by <code>codoc</code>.  However, there are two
problems with the generic primitives.  The first is that many of the
operators are part of the S3 group generic <code>Ops</code> and that defines
their arguments to be <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code>: although it would be very
unusual, an operator could be called as e.g. <code>"+"(e1=a, e2=b)</code>
and if method dispatch occurred to a closure, there would be an argument
name mismatch.  So the definitions in environment <code>.GenericArgsEnv</code>
have to use argument names <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> even though the
traditional documentation is in terms of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:
<code>codoc</code> makes the appropriate adjustment via
<code>tools:::.make_S3_primitive_generic_env</code>.  The second discrepancy
is with the <code>Math</code> group generics, where the group generic is
defined with argument list <code>(x, ...)</code>, but most of the members only
allow one argument when used as the default method (and <code>round</code> and
<code>signif</code> allow two as default methods): again fix-ups are used.

   <p>Those primitives which are in <code>.GenericArgsEnv</code> are checked (via
<samp><span class="file">tests/primitives.R</span></samp>) to be generic <em>via</em> defining methods for
them, and a check is made that the remaining primitives are probably not
generic, by setting a method and checking it is not dispatched to (but
this can fail for other reasons).  However, there is no certain way to
know that if other <code>.Internal</code> or primitive functions are not
internally generic except by reading the source code.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Internationalization in the R sources</h2>

<p>The process of marking messages (errors, warnings etc) for translation
in an R package is described in
<a href="R-exts.html#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>,
and the standard packages included with R have (with an exception in
<strong>grDevices</strong> for the menus of the <code>windows()</code> device) been
internationalized in the same way as other packages.

</div>

<h3 class="section">3.1 R code</h3>

<p>Internationalization for R code is done in exactly the same way as
for extension packages.  As all standard packages which have R code
also have a namespace, it is never necessary to specify <code>domain</code>,
but for efficiency calls to <code>message</code>, <code>warning</code> and
<code>stop</code> should include <code>domain = NA</code> when the message is
constructed <em>via</em> <code>gettextf</code>, <code>gettext</code> or
<code>ngettext</code>.

   <p>For each package, the extracted messages and translation sources are
stored under package directory <samp><span class="file">po</span></samp> in the source package, and
compiled translations under <samp><span class="file">inst/po</span></samp> for installation to package
directory <samp><span class="file">po</span></samp> in the installed package.  This also applies to C
code in packages.

</div>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Main C code</h3>

<p>The main C code (e.g. that in files <samp><span class="file">src/*/*.c</span></samp> and in
the modules) is where R is closest to the sort of application for
which ‘<samp><span class="samp">gettext</span></samp>’ was written.  Messages in the main C code are in
domain <code>R</code> and stored in the top-level directory <samp><span class="file">po</span></samp> with
compiled translations under <samp><span class="file">share/locale</span></samp>.

   <p>The list of files covered by the R domain is specified in file
<samp><span class="file">po/POTFILES.in</span></samp>.

   <p>The normal way to mark messages for translation is via <code>_("msg")</code>
just as for packages.  However, sometimes one needs to mark passages for
translation without wanting them translated at the time, for example
when declaring string constants.  This is the purpose of the <code>N_</code>
macro, for example

<pre class="example">     { ERROR_ARGTYPE,           N_("invalid argument type")},
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">from file <samp><span class="file">src/main/errors.c</span></samp>.

   <p>The <code>P_</code> macro

<pre class="example">     #ifdef ENABLE_NLS
     #define P_(StringS, StringP, N) ngettext (StringS, StringP, N)
     #else
     #define P_(StringS, StringP, N) (N &gt; 1 ? StringP: StringS)
     #endif
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">may be used
as a wrapper for <code>ngettext</code>: however in some cases the preferred
approach has been to conditionalize (on <code>ENABLE_NLS</code>) code using
<code>ngettext</code>.

   <p>The macro <code>_("msg")</code> can safely be used in directory
<samp><span class="file">src/appl</span></samp>; the header for standalone ‘<samp><span class="samp">nmath</span></samp>’ skips possible
translation.  (This does not apply to <code>N_</code> or <code>P_</code>).

<h3 class="section">3.3 Windows-GUI-specific code</h3>

<p>Messages for the Windows GUI are in a separate domain ‘<samp><span class="samp">RGui</span></samp>’.  This
was done for two reasons:

     <ul>
<li>The translators for the Windows version of R might be separate from
those for the rest of R (familiarity with the GUI helps), and

     <li>Messages for Windows are most naturally handled in the native charset
for the language, and in the case of CJK languages the charset is
Windows-specific.  (It transpires that as the <code>iconv</code> we ported
works well under Windows, this is less important than anticipated.) 
</ul>

   <p>Messages for the ‘<samp><span class="samp">RGui</span></samp>’ domain are marked by <code>G_("msg")</code>, a
macro that is defined in header file <samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/win-nls.h</span></samp>.  The
list of files that are considered is hardcoded in the
<code>RGui.pot-update</code> target of file <samp><span class="file">po/Makefile.in.in</span></samp>: note
that this includes <samp><span class="file">devWindows.c</span></samp> as the menus on the
<code>windows</code> device are considered to be part of the GUI.  (There is
also <code>GN_("msg")</code>, the analogue of <code>N_("msg")</code>.)

   <p>The template and message catalogs for the ‘<samp><span class="samp">RGui</span></samp>’ domain are in the
top-level <samp><span class="file">po</span></samp> directory.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Structure of an Installed Package</h2>

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Metadata">Metadata</a>
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#Help">Help</a>
</ul>

<p>The structure of a <em>source</em> packages is described in <a href="R-exts.html#Creating-R-packages">Creating R packages</a>: this
chapter is concerned with the structure of <em>installed</em> packages.

   <p>An installed package has a top-level file <samp><span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span></samp>, a copy of
the file of that name in the package sources with a ‘<samp><span class="samp">Built</span></samp>’ field
appended, and file <samp><span class="file">INDEX</span></samp>, usually describing the objects on which
help is available, a file <samp><span class="file">NAMESPACE</span></samp> if the package has a name
space, optional files such as <samp><span class="file">CITATION</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">LICENCE</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">NEWS</span></samp>, and any other files copied in from <samp><span class="file">inst</span></samp>.  It will
have directories <samp><span class="file">Meta</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">help</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">html</span></samp> (even if the
package has no help pages), almost always has a directory <samp><span class="file">R</span></samp> and
often has a directory <samp><span class="file">libs</span></samp> to contain compiled code.  Other
directories with known meaning to R are <samp><span class="file">data</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">demo</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">po</span></samp>.

   <p>Function <code>library</code> looks for a namespace and if one is found
passes control to <code>loadNamespace</code>.  Then <code>library</code> or
<code>loadNamespace</code> looks for file <samp><span class="file">R/</span><var>pkgname</var></samp>, warns if it
is not found and otherwise sources the code (using <code>sys.source</code>)
into the package's environment, then lazy-loads a database
<samp><span class="file">R/sysdata</span></samp> if present.  So how R code gets loaded depends on
the contents of  <samp><span class="file">R/</span><var>pkgname</var></samp>: a standard template to load
lazy-load databases are provided in <samp><span class="file">share/R/nspackloader.R</span></samp>.

   <p>Compiled code is usually loaded when the package's namespace is loaded
by a <code>useDynlib</code> directive in a <samp><span class="file">NAMESPACE</span></samp> file or by the
package's <code>.onLoad</code> function.  Conventionally compiled code is
loaded by a call to <code>library.dynam</code> and this looks in directory
<samp><span class="file">libs</span></samp> (and in an appropriate sub-directory if sub-architectures
are in use) for a shared object (Unix-alike) or DLL (Windows).

   <p>Subdirectory <samp><span class="file">data</span></samp> serves two purposes. In a package using
lazy-loading of data, it contains a lazy-load database <samp><span class="file">Rdata</span></samp>,
plus a file <samp><span class="file">Rdata.rds</span></samp> which contain a named character vector used
by <code>data()</code> in the (unusual) event that it is used for such a
package.  Otherwise it is a copy of the <samp><span class="file">data</span></samp> directory in the
sources, with saved images re-compressed if <samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL
--resave-data</span></samp> was used.  Prior to R 2.12.0 the contents of the
directory could be moved to a zip file <samp><span class="file">Rdata.zip</span></samp> and a listing
written in file <samp><span class="file">filelist</span></samp>: this was principally done on Windows.

   <p>Subdirectory <samp><span class="file">demo</span></samp> supports the <code>demo</code> function, and is
copied from the sources.

   <p>Subdirectory <samp><span class="file">po</span></samp> contains (in subdirectories) compiled message
catalogs.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Metadata</h3>

<p>Directory <samp><span class="file">Meta</span></samp> contains several files in <code>.rds</code> format, that
is serialized R objects written by <code>saveRDS</code>.  All packages
have files <samp><span class="file">Rd.rds</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">hsearch.rds</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">links.rds</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">package.rds</span></samp>.  Packages with namespaces have a file
<samp><span class="file">nsInfo.rds</span></samp>, and those with data, demos or vignettes have
<samp><span class="file">data.rds</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">demo.rds</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">vignette.rds</span></samp> files.

   <p>The structure of these files (and their existence and names) is private
to R, so the description here is for those trying to follow the R
sources: there should be no reference to these files in non-base
packages.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">package.rds</span></samp> is a dump of information extracted from the
<samp><span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span></samp> file.  It is a list of several components.  The
first, ‘<samp><span class="samp">DESCRIPTION</span></samp>’, is a character vector, the <samp><span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span></samp>
file as read by <code>read.dcf</code>.  Further elements ‘<samp><span class="samp">Depends</span></samp>’,
‘<samp><span class="samp">Suggests</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">Imports</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">Rdepends</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">Rdepends2</span></samp>’
record the ‘<samp><span class="samp">Depends</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">Suggests</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">Imports</span></samp>’ fields. 
These are all lists, and can be empty.  The first three have an entry
for each package named, each entry being a list of length 1 or 3, which
element ‘<samp><span class="samp">name</span></samp>’ (the package name) and optional elements ‘<samp><span class="samp">op</span></samp>’
(a character string) and ‘<samp><span class="samp">version</span></samp>’ (an object of class
‘<samp><span class="samp">"package_version"</span></samp>’).  Element ‘<samp><span class="samp">Rdepends</span></samp>’ is used for the
first version dependency on R, and ‘<samp><span class="samp">Rdepends2</span></samp>’ is a list of zero
or more R version dependencies&mdash;each is a three-element list of the
form described for packages.  Element ‘<samp><span class="samp">Rdepends</span></samp>’ is no longer used,
but it is still potentially needed so R &lt; 2.7.0 can detect that the
package was not installed for it.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">nsInfo.rds</span></samp> records a list, a parsed version of the
<samp><span class="file">NAMESPACE</span></samp> file.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">Rd.rds</span></samp> records a data frame with one row for each help file. 
The (character) columns are ‘<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>’ (the file name with extension),
‘<samp><span class="samp">Name</span></samp>’ (the ‘<samp><span class="samp">\name</span></samp>’ section), ‘<samp><span class="samp">Type</span></samp>’ (from the optional
‘<samp><span class="samp">\docType</span></samp>’ section), ‘<samp><span class="samp">Title</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">Encoding</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">Aliases</span></samp>’,
‘<samp><span class="samp">Concepts</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">Keywords</span></samp>’.  The last three are character
strings with zero or more entries separated by ‘<samp><span class="samp">, </span></samp>’.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">hsearch.rds</span></samp> records the information to be used by
‘<samp><span class="samp">help.search</span></samp>’.  This is a list of four unnamed elements which are
character vectors for help files, aliases, keywords and concepts.  All
the matrices have columns ‘<samp><span class="samp">ID</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">Package</span></samp>’ which are used to
tie the aliases, keywords and concepts (the remaining column of the last
three elements) to a particular help file.  The first element has
further columns ‘<samp><span class="samp">LibPath</span></samp>’ (empty since R 2.3.0), ‘<samp><span class="samp">name</span></samp>’,
‘<samp><span class="samp">title</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">topic</span></samp>’ (the first alias, used when presenting the
results as ‘<samp><var>pkgname</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>topic</var></samp>’) and ‘<samp><span class="samp">Encoding</span></samp>’.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">links.rds</span></samp> records a named character vector, the names being
aliases and the values character strings of the form
<pre class="example">     "../../<var>pkgname</var>/html/<var>filename</var>.html"
</pre>
   <p>File <samp><span class="file">data.rds</span></samp> records a two-column character matrix with columns
of dataset names and titles from the corresponding help file.  File
<samp><span class="file">demo.rds</span></samp> has the same structure for package demos.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">vignette.rds</span></samp> records a dataframe with one row for each
‘vignette’ (<samp><span class="file">.[RS]nw</span></samp> file in <samp><span class="file">inst/doc</span></samp>) and with columns
‘<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>’ (the full file path in the sources), ‘<samp><span class="samp">Title</span></samp>’,
‘<samp><span class="samp">PDF</span></samp>’ (the pathless file name of the installed PDF version, if
present), ‘<samp><span class="samp">Depends</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">Keywords</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>’ (the pathless
file name of the installed R code, if present).

<h3 class="section">4.2 Help</h3>

<p>All installed packages, whether they had any <samp><span class="file">.Rd</span></samp> files or not,
have <samp><span class="file">help</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">html</span></samp> directories. The latter normally only
contains the single file <samp><span class="file">00Index.html</span></samp>, the package index which
has hyperlinks to the help topics (if any).

   <p>Directory <samp><span class="file">help</span></samp> contains files <samp><span class="file">AnIndex</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">paths.rds</span></samp>
and <samp><var>pkgname</var><span class="file">.rd[bx]</span></samp>.  The latter two files are a lazy-load
database of parsed <samp><span class="file">.Rd</span></samp> files, accessed by
<code>tools:::fetchRdDB</code>.  File <samp><span class="file">paths.rds</span></samp> is a saved character
vector of the original path names of the <samp><span class="file">.Rd</span></samp> files, used when
updating the database.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">AnIndex</span></samp> is a two-column tab-delimited file: the first column
contains the aliases defined in the help files and the second the
basename (without the <samp><span class="file">.Rd</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.rd</span></samp> extension) of the file
containing that alias.  It is read by <code>utils:::index.search</code> to
search for files matching a topic (alias), and read by <code>scan</code> in
<code>utils:::matchAvailableTopics</code>, part of the completion system.

   <p>File <samp><span class="file">aliases.rds</span></samp> is the same information as <samp><span class="file">AnIndex</span></samp> as a
named character vector (names the topics, values the file basename), for
faster access.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Files</h2>

<p>R provides many functions to work with files and directories: many of
these have been added relatively recently to facilitate scripting in
R and in particular the replacement of Perl scripts by R scripts
in the management of R itself.

   <p>These functions are implemented by standard C/POSIX library calls,
except on Windows.  That means that filenames must be encoded in the
current locale as the OS provides no other means to access the file
system: increasingly filenames are stored in UTF-8 and the OS will
translate filenames to UTF-8 in other locales.  So using a UTF-8 locale
gives transparent access to the whole file system.

   <p>Windows is another story.  There the internal view of filenames is in
UTF-16LE (so-called ‘Unicode’), and standard C library calls can only
access files whose names can be expressed in the current codepage.  To
circumvent that restriction, there is a parallel set of Windows-specific
calls which take wide-character arguments for filepaths.  Much of the
file-handling in R has been moved over to using these functions, so
filenames can be manipulated in R as UTF-8 encoded character strings,
converted to wide characters (which on Windows are UTF-16LE) and passed
to the OS.  The utilities <code>RC_fopen</code> and <code>filenameToWchar</code>
help this process.  Currently <code>file.copy</code> to a directory,
<code>list.files</code>, <code>list.dirs</code> and <code>path.expand</code> work only
with filepaths encoded in the current codepage.

   <p>All these functions do tilde expansion, in the same way as
<code>path.expand</code>, with the deliberate exception of <code>Sys.glob</code>.

   <p>File names may be case sensitive or not: the latter is the norm on
Windows and Mac OS X, the former on other Unix-alikes.  Note that this
is a property of both the OS and the file system: it is often possible
to map names to upper or lower case when mounting the file system.  This
can affect the matching of patterns in <code>list.files</code> and
<code>Sys.glob</code>.

   <p>File names commonly contain spaces on Windows and Mac OS X but not
elsewhere.  As file names are handled as character strings by R,
spaces are not usually a concern unless file names are passed to other
process, e.g. by a <code>system</code> call.

   <p>Windows has another couple of peculiarities.  Whereas a POSIX file
system has a single root directory (and other physical file systems are
mounted onto logical directories under that root), Windows has separate
roots for each physical or logical file system (‘volume’), organized
under <em>drives</em> (with file paths starting <code>D:</code> for an ASCII
letter, case-insensitively) and <em>network shares</em> (with paths like
<code>\netname\topdir\myfiles\a file</code>.  There is a current drive, and
path names without a drive part are relative to the current drive. 
Further, each drive has a current directory, and relative paths are
relative to that current directory, on a particular drive if one is
specified.  So <samp><span class="file">D:dir\file</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">D:</span></samp> are valid path
specifications (the last being the current directory on drive
<samp><span class="file">D:</span></samp>).

<h2 class="chapter">6 Graphics</h2>

<p>R's graphics internals were revised for version 1.4.0 (and tidied up
for 2.7.0).  This was to enable multiple graphics systems to be
installed on top on the graphics ‘engine’ &ndash; currently there are two
such systems, one supporting ‘base’ graphics (based on that in S and
whose R code<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-15" name="fnd-15"><sup>15</sup></a> is in package <strong>graphics</strong>) and one
implemented in package <strong>grid</strong>.

   <p>Some notes on the changes for 1.4.0 can be found at
<a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/basegraph.html">http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/basegraph.html</a> and
<a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/graphicsChanges.html">http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/graphicsChanges.html</a>.

   <p>At the lowest level is a graphics device, which manages a plotting
surface (a screen window or a representation to be written to a file). 
This implements a set of graphics primitives, to ‘draw’

     <ul>
<li>a circle, optionally filled
<li>a rectangle, optionally filled
<li>a line
<li>a set of connected lines
<li>a polygon, optionally filled
<li>a paths, optionally filled using a winding rule
<li>text
<li>a raster image (optional)
<li>and to set a clipping rectangle
</ul>

<p class="noindent">as well as requests for information such as

     <ul>
<li>the width of a string if plotted
<li>the metrics (width, ascent, descent) of a single character
<li>the current size of the plotting surface
</ul>

<p class="noindent">and requests/opportunities to take action such as

     <ul>
<li>start a new ‘page’, possibly after responding to a request to ask
the user for confirmation. 
<li>return the position of the device pointer (if any). 
<li>when a device become the current device or stops being the current
device (this is usually used to change the window title on a screen
device). 
<li>when drawing starts or finishes (e.g. used to flush graphics to
the screen when drawing stops). 
<li>wait for an event, for example a mouse click or keypress. 
<li>an ‘onexit’ action, to clean up if plotting is interrupted (by an
error or by the user). 
<li>capture the current contents of the device as a raster image. 
<li>close the device. 
</ul>

   <p>The device also sets a number of variables, mainly Boolean flags
indicating its capabilities.  Devices work entirely in ‘device units’
which are up to its developer: they can be in pixels, big points (1/72
inch), twips, <small class="dots">...</small>, and can differ<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-16" name="fnd-16"><sup>16</sup></a> in the ‘<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>’ directions.

<!-- think of the engine as colors.c, devices.c, engine.c, plotmath.c, vfonts.c -->
<p>The next layer up is the graphics ‘engine’ that is the main interface to
the device (although the graphics subsystems do talk directly to
devices).  This is responsible for clipping lines, rectangles and
polygons, converting the <code>pch</code> values <code>0...26</code> to sets of
lines/circles, centring (and otherwise adjusting) text, rendering
mathematical expressions (‘plotmath’) and mapping colour descriptions
such as names to the internal representation.

<!-- graphics.c looks at device dimensions, locator, metricinfo -->
<!-- par.c looks at various device pars -->
<!-- plot3d.c looks at useRotatedTextInContour -->
<!-- grid looks at size, clipping, locator, ipr -->
<p>Another function of the engine is to manage display lists and snapshots. 
Some but not all instances of graphics devices maintain display lists, a
‘list’ of operations that have been performed on the device to produce
the current plot (since the device was opened or the plot was last
cleared, e.g. by <code>plot.new</code>).  Screen devices generally maintain
a display list to handle repaint and resize events whereas file-based
formats do not&mdash;display lists are also used to implement
<code>dev.copy()</code> and friends.  The display list is a pairlist of
<code>.Internal</code> (base graphics) or <code>.Call.graphics</code> (grid
graphics) calls, which means that the C code implementing a graphics
operation will be re-called when the display list is replayed: apart
from the part which records the operation if successful.

   <p>Snapshots of the current graphics state are taken by
<code>GEcreateSnapshot</code> and replayed later in the session by
<code>GEplaySnapshot</code>.  These are used by <code>recordPlot()</code>,
<code>replayPlot()</code> and the GUI menus of the <code>windows()</code> device. 
The ‘state’ includes the display list.

   <p>The top layer comprises the graphics subsystems. Although there is
provision for 24 subsystems, after 6 years only two exist, ‘base’ and
‘grid’.  The base subsystem is registered with the engine when R is
initialized, and unregistered (via <code>KillAllDevices</code>) when an R
session is shut down.  The grid subsystem is registered in its
<code>.onLoad</code> function and unregistered in the <code>.onUnload</code>
function.  The graphics subsystem may also have ‘state’ information
saved in a snapshot (currently base does and grid does not).

   <p>Package <strong>grDevices</strong> was originally created to contain the basic
graphics devices (although <code>X11</code> is in a separate load-on-demand
module because of the volume of external libraries it brings in).  Since
then it has been used for other functionality that was thought desirable
for use with <strong>grid</strong>, and hence has been transferred from package
<strong>graphics</strong> to <strong>grDevices</strong>.  This is principally concerned with
the handling of colours and recording and replaying plots.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.1 Device structures</h4>

<p>There are two types used internally which are pointers to structures
related to graphics devices.

   <p>The <code>DevDesc</code> type is a structure defined in the header file
<samp><span class="file">R_ext/GraphicsDevice.h</span></samp> (which is included by
<samp><span class="file">R_ext/GraphicsEngine.h</span></samp>).  This describes the physical
characteristics of a device, the capabilities of the device driver and
contains a set of callback functions that will be used by the graphics
engine to obtain information about the device and initiate actions
(e.g. a new page, plotting a line or some text).  Type <code>pDevDesc</code>
is a pointer to this type.

   <p>Prior to R 2.14.0 all of the callback functions need to be set, to
dummy functions if the capability (such as a locator) is not available. 
In devices which will only be used in R 2.14.0 or later the following
callbacks can be omitted (or set to the null pointer, their default
value) when appropriate default behaviour will be taken by the graphics
engine: <code>activate</code>, <code>cap</code>, <code>deactivate</code>, <code>locator</code>,
<code>holdflush</code> (API version 9), <code>mode</code>, <code>newFrameConfirm</code>,
<code>path</code>, <code>raster</code> and <code>size</code>.

   <p>The relationship of device units to physical dimensions is set by the
element <code>ipr</code> of the <code>DevDesc</code> structure: a ‘<samp><span class="samp">double</span></samp>’
array of length 2.

   <p>The <code>GEDevDesc</code> type is a structure defined in
<samp><span class="file">R_ext/GraphicsEngine.h</span></samp> (with comments in the file) as

<pre class="example">     typedef struct _GEDevDesc GEDevDesc;
     struct _GEDevDesc {
         pDevDesc dev;
         Rboolean displayListOn;
         SEXP displayList;
         SEXP DLlastElt;
         SEXP savedSnapshot;
         Rboolean dirty;
         Rboolean recordGraphics;
         GESystemDesc *gesd[MAX_GRAPHICS_SYSTEMS];
         Rboolean ask;
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">So this is essentially a device structure plus information about the
device maintained by the graphics engine and normally<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-17" name="fnd-17"><sup>17</sup></a> visible to the engine
and not to the device.  Type <code>pGEDevDesc</code> is a pointer to this
type.

   <p>The graphics engine maintains an array of devices, as pointers to
<code>GEDevDesc</code> structures.  The array is of size 64 but the first
element is always occupied by the <code>"null device"</code> and the final
element is kept as NULL as a sentinel.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-18" name="fnd-18"><sup>18</sup></a>  This array is reflected in the R variable
‘<samp><span class="samp">.Devices</span></samp>’.  Once a device is killed its element becomes available
for reallocation (and its name will appear as <code>""</code> in
‘<samp><span class="samp">.Devices</span></samp>’).  Exactly one of the devices is ‘active’: this is the
the null device if no other device has been opened and not killed.

   <p>Each instance of a graphics device needs to set up a <code>GEDevDesc</code>
structure by code very similar to

<pre class="example">         pGEDevDesc gdd;
     
         R_GE_checkVersionOrDie(R_GE_version);
         R_CheckDeviceAvailable();
         BEGIN_SUSPEND_INTERRUPTS {
             pDevDesc dev;
             /* Allocate and initialize the device driver data */
             if (!(dev = (pDevDesc) calloc(1, sizeof(DevDesc))))
                 return 0; /* or error() */
             /* set up device driver or free ‘dev’ and error() */
             gdd = GEcreateDevDesc(dev);
             GEaddDevice2(gdd, "dev_name");
         } END_SUSPEND_INTERRUPTS;
</pre>
   <p>The <code>DevDesc</code> structure contains a <code>void *</code> pointer
‘<samp><span class="samp">deviceSpecific</span></samp>’ which is used to store data specific to the
device.  Setting up the device driver includes initializing all the
non-zero elements of the <code>DevDesc</code> structure.

   <p>Note that the device structure is zeroed when allocated: this provides
some protection against future expansion of the structure since the
graphics engine can add elements that need to be non-NULL/non-zero to be
‘on’ (and the structure ends with 64 reserved bytes which will be zeroed
and allow for future expansion).

   <p>Rather more protection is provided by the version number of the
engine/device API, <code>R_GE_version</code> defined in
<samp><span class="file">R_ext/GraphicsEngine.h</span></samp> together with access functions

<pre class="example">     int R_GE_getVersion(void);
     void R_GE_checkVersionOrDie(int version);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If a graphics device calls <code>R_GE_checkVersionOrDie(R_GE_version)</code>
it can ensure it will only be used in versions of R which provide the
API it was designed for and compiled against.

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.2 Device capabilities</h4>

<p>The following ‘capabilities’ can be defined for the device's
<code>DevDesc</code> structure.

     <ul>
<li><code>canChangeGamma</code> &ndash;
<code>Rboolean</code>: can the display gamma be adjusted?  This is now
ignored, as gamma support has been removed. 
<li><code>canHadj</code> &ndash;
<code>integer</code>: can the device do horizontal adjustment of text
<em>via</em> the <code>text</code> callback, and if so, how precisely? 0 = no
adjustment, 1 = {0, 0.5, 1} (left, centre, right justification) or 2 =
continuously variable (in [0,1]) between left and right justification. 
<li><code>canGenMouseDown</code> &ndash;
<code>Rboolean</code>: can the device handle mouse down events?  This
flag and the next three are not currently used by R, but are maintained
for back compatibility. 
<li><code>canGenMouseMove</code> &ndash;
<code>Rboolean</code>: ditto for mouse move events. 
<li><code>canGenMouseUp</code> &ndash;
<code>Rboolean</code>: ditto for mouse up events. 
<li><code>canGenKeybd</code> &ndash;
<code>Rboolean</code>: ditto for keyboard events. 
<li><code>hasTextUTF8</code> &ndash;
<code>Rboolean</code>: should non-symbol text be sent (in UTF-8) to the
<code>textUTF8</code> and <code>strWidthUTF8</code> callbacks, and sent as Unicode
points (negative values) to the <code>metricInfo</code> callback? 
<li><code>wantSymbolUTF8</code> &ndash;
<code>Rboolean</code>: should symbol text be handled in UTF-8 in the same way
as other text?  Requires <code>textUTF8 = TRUE</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Several more were added at R 2.14.0 to support the
<code>dev.capabilities</code> function: these are all small integers.
     <ul>
<li><code>haveTransparency</code>:
does the device support semi-transparent colours? 
<li><code>haveTransparentBg</code>:
can the background be fully or semi-transparent? 
<li><code>haveRaster</code>:
is there support for rendering raster images? 
<li><code>haveCapture</code>:
is there support for <code>grid::grid.cap</code>? 
<li><code>haveLocator</code>:
is there an interactive locator? 
</ul>

   <p>The last three can often be deduced to be false from the presence of
<code>NULL</code> entries instead of the corresponding functions.

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.3 Handling text</h4>

<p>Handling text is probably the hardest task for a graphics device, and
the design allows for the device to optionally indicate that it has
additional capabilities.  (If the device does not, these will if
possible be handled in the graphics engine.)

   <p>The three callbacks for handling text that must be in all graphics
devices are <code>text</code>, <code>strWidth</code> and <code>metricInfo</code> with
declarations

<pre class="example">     void text(double x, double y, const char *str, double rot, double hadj,
               pGgcontext gc, pDevDesc dd);
     
     double strWidth(const char *str, pGEcontext gc, pDevDesc dd);
     
     void metricInfo(int c, pGEcontext gc,
                    double* ascent, double* descent, double* width,
                    pDevDesc dd);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The ‘<samp><span class="samp">gc</span></samp>’ parameter provides the graphics context, most importantly
the current font and fontsize, and ‘<samp><span class="samp">dd</span></samp>’ is a pointer to the active
device's structure.

   <p>The <code>text</code> callback should plot ‘<samp><span class="samp">str</span></samp>’ at `<samp><span class="samp">(x,
y)</span></samp>'<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-19" name="fnd-19"><sup>19</sup></a> with an anti-clockwise rotation of
‘<samp><span class="samp">rot</span></samp>’ degrees.  (For ‘<samp><span class="samp">hadj</span></samp>’ see below.)  The interpretation
for horizontal text is that the baseline is at <code>y</code> and the start is
a <code>x</code>, so any left bearing for the first character will start at
<code>x</code>.

   <p>The <code>strWidth</code> callback computes the width of the string which it
would occupy if plotted horizontally in the current font.  (Width here
is expected to include both (preferably) or neither of left and right
bearings.)

   <p>The <code>metricInfo</code> callback computes the size of a single
character: <code>ascent</code> is the distance it extends above the baseline
and <code>descent</code> how far it extends below the baseline. 
<code>width</code> is the amount by which the cursor should be advanced when
the character is placed.  For <code>ascent</code> and <code>descent</code> this is
intended to be the bounding box of the ‘ink’ put down by the glyph and
not the box which might be used when assembling a line of conventional
text (it needs to be for e.g. <code>hat(beta)</code> to work correctly). 
However, the <code>width</code> is used in plotmath to advance to the next
character, and so needs to include left and right bearings.

   <p>The <em>interpretation</em> of ‘<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>’ depends on the locale.  In a
single-byte locale values <code>32...255</code> indicate the corresponding
character in the locale (if present).  For the symbol font (as used by
‘<samp><span class="samp">graphics::par(font=5)</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">grid::gpar(fontface=5</span></samp>’) and by
‘plotmath’), values <code>32...126, 161...239, 241...254</code> indicate
glyphs in the Adobe Symbol encoding.  In a multibyte locale, <code>c</code>
represents a Unicode point (except in the symbol font).  So the function
needs to include code like

<pre class="example">         Rboolean Unicode = mbcslocale &amp;&amp; (gc-&gt;fontface != 5);
         if (c &lt; 0) { Unicode = TRUE; c = -c; }
         if(Unicode) UniCharMetric(c, ...); else CharMetric(c, ...);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In addition, if device capability <code>hasTextUTF8</code> (see below) is
true, Unicode points will be passed as negative values: the code snippet
above shows how to handle this.  (This applies to the symbol font only
if device capability <code>wantSymbolUTF8</code> is true.)

   <p>If possible, the graphics device should handle clipping of text.  It
indicates this by the structure element <code>canClip</code> which if true
will result in calls to the callback <code>clip</code> to set the clipping
region. If this is not done, the engine will clip very crudely (by
omitting any text that does not appear to be wholly inside the clipping
region).

   <p>The device structure has an integer element <code>canHadj</code>, which
indicates if the device can do horizontal alignment of text.  If this is
one, argument ‘<samp><span class="samp">hadj</span></samp>’ to <code>text</code> will be called as <code>0 ,0.5,
1</code> to indicate left-, centre- and right-alignment at the indicated
position.  If it is two, continuous values in the range <code>[0, 1]</code>
are assumed to be supported.

   <p>A new capability in R 2.7.0 (graphics API version 4) was
<code>hasTextUTF8</code>.  If this is true, it has two consequences.  First,
there are callbacks <code>textUTF8</code> and <code>strWidthUTF8</code> that should
behave identically to <code>text</code> and <code>strWidth</code> except that
‘<samp><span class="samp">str</span></samp>’ is assumed to be in UTF-8 rather than the current locale's
encoding.  The graphics engine will call these for all text except in
the symbol font.  Second, Unicode points will be passed to the
<code>metricInfo</code> callback as negative integers.  If your device would
prefer to have UTF-8-encoded symbols, define <code>wantSymbolUTF8</code> as
well as <code>hasTextUTF8</code>.  In that case text in the symbol font is
sent to <code>textUTF8</code> and <code>strWidthUTF8</code>.

   <p>Some devices can produce high-quality rotated text, but those based on
bitmaps often cannot.  Those which can should set
<code>useRotatedTextInContour</code> to be true from graphics API version 4.

   <p>Several other elements relate to the precise placement of text by the
graphics engine:

<pre class="example">     double xCharOffset;
     double yCharOffset;
     double yLineBias;
     double cra[2];
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">These are more than a little mysterious.  Element <code>cra</code> provides an
indication of the character size, <code>par("cra")</code> in base graphics, in
device units.  The mystery is what is meant by ‘character size’: which
character, which font at which size?  Some help can be obtained by
looking at what this is used for.  The first element, ‘width’, is not
used by R except to set the graphical parameters.  The second,
‘height’, is use to set the line spacing, that is the relationship
between <code>par("mai")</code> and <code>par("mai")</code> and so on.  It is
suggested that a good choice is

<pre class="example">     dd-&gt;cra[0] = 0.9 * fnsize;
     dd-&gt;cra[1] = 1.2 * fnsize;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where ‘<samp><span class="samp">fnsize</span></samp>’ is the ‘size’ of the standard font (<code>cex=1</code>)
on the device, in device units.  So for a 12-point font (the usual
default for graphics devices), ‘<samp><span class="samp">fnsize</span></samp>’ should be 12 points in
device units.

   <p>The remaining elements are yet more mysterious.  The <code>postscript()</code>
device says

attempting exact centring of text, such as character string values of

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.4 Conventions</h4>

<p>The aim is to make the (default) output from graphics devices as similar
as possible.  Generally people follow the model of the <code>postscript</code>
and <code>pdf</code> devices (which share most of their internal code).

   <p>The following conventions have become established:

     <ul>
<li>The default size of a device should be 7 inches square.

     <li>There should be a ‘<samp><span class="samp">pointsize</span></samp>’ argument which defaults to 12, and it
should give the pointsize in big points (1/72 inch).  How exactly this
is interpreted is font-specific, but it should use a font which works
with lines packed 1/6 inch apart, and looks good with lines 1/5 inch
apart (that is with 2pt leading).

     <li>The default font family should be a sans serif font, e.g Helvetica or
similar (e.g. Arial on Windows).

     <li><code>lwd = 1</code> should correspond to a line width of 1/96 inch.  This
will be a problem with pixel-based devices, and generally there is a
minimum line width of 1 pixel (although this may not be appropriate
where anti-aliasing of lines is used, and <code>cairo</code> prefers a minimum
of 2 pixels).

     <li>Even very small circles should be visible, e.g. by using a minimum
radius of 1 pixel or replacing very small circles by a single filled
pixel.

     <li>How RGB colour values will be interpreted should be documented, and
preferably be sRGB.

     <li>The help page should describe its policy on these conventions.

   </ul>

   <p>These conventions are less clear-cut for bitmap devices, especially
where the bitmap format does not have a design resolution.

   <p>The interpretation of the line texture (<code>par("lty"</code>) is described
in the header <samp><span class="file">GraphicsEngine.h</span></samp> and in the help for <code>par</code>: note that the
‘scale’ of the pattern should be proportional to the line width (at
least for widths above the default).

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.5 ‘Mode’</h4>

<p>One of the device callbacks is a function <code>mode</code>, documented in
the header as

<pre class="example">          * device_Mode is called whenever the graphics engine
          * starts drawing (mode=1) or stops drawing (mode=0)
          * GMode (in graphics.c) also says that
          * mode = 2 (graphical input on) exists.
          * The device is not required to do anything
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Since <code>mode = 2</code> has only recently been documented at device level,
it is not surprising that was it not used by any device: prior to R
2.7.0 it was not set by <code>grid::grid.locator</code>.  It could be used to
change the graphics cursor, but devices currently do that in the
<code>locator</code> callback.  (In base graphics the mode is set for the
duration of a <code>locator</code> call, but if <code>type != "n"</code> is switched
back for each point whilst annotation is being done.)

   <p>Many devices do indeed do nothing on this call, but some screen devices
ensure that drawing is flushed to the screen when called with <code>mode
= 0</code>.  It is tempting to use it for some sort of buffering, but note
that ‘drawing’ is interpreted at quite a low level and a typical single
figure will stop and start drawing many times.  The buffering introduced
in the <code>X11()</code> device makes use of <code>mode = 0</code> to indicate
activity: it updates the screen after <em>ca</em> 100ms of inactivity.

   <p>As from R 2.14.0 this callback need not be supplied if it does nothing.

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.6 Graphics events</h4>

<p>Graphics devices may be designed to handle user interaction. 
The current model is similar to the one introduced in R 2.1.0 for
the Windows screen device, but the design was changed in R 2.12.0 to
be more open ended.

   <p>Users may use <code>grDevices::setGraphicsEventEnv</code> to set the
<code>eventEnv</code> environment in the device driver to hold event
handlers. When the user calls <code>grDevices::getGraphicsEvent</code>, R will
take three steps.  First, it sets the device driver member
<code>gettingEvent</code> to <code>true</code> for each device with a
non-<code>NULL</code> <code>eventEnv</code> entry, and calls <code>initEvent(dd,
true)</code> if the callback is defined.  It then enters an event loop.  Each
time through the loop R will process events once, then check whether any
device has set the <code>result</code> member of <code>eventEnv</code> to a
non-<code>NULL</code> value, and will save the first such value found to be
returned.  C functions <code>doMouseEvent</code> and <code>doKeybd</code> are
provided to call the R event handlers <code>onMouseDown</code>,
<code>onMouseMove</code>, <code>onMouseUp</code>, and <code>onKeybd</code> and set
<code>eventEnv$result</code> during this step.  Finally, <code>initEvent</code> is
called again with <code>init=false</code> to inform the the devices that the
loop is done, and the result is returned to the user.

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.7 Specific devices</h4>

<p>Specific devices are mostly documented by comments in their sources,
although for devices of many years' standing those comments can be in
need of updating.  This subsection is a repository of notes on design
decisions.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.7.1 X11()</h5>

<p>The <code>X11(type="Xlib")</code> device dates back to the mid 1990's and was
written then in <code>Xlib</code>, the most basic X11 toolkit.  It has since
optionally made use of a few features from other toolkits: <code>libXt</code>
is used to read X11 resources, and <code>libXmu</code> is used in the handling
of clipboard selections.

   <p>Using basic <code>Xlib</code> code makes drawing fast, but is limiting.  There
is no support of translucent colours (that came in the <code>Xrender</code>
toolkit of 2000) nor for rotated text (which R implements by
rendering text to a bitmap and rotating the latter).

   <p>The hinting for the X11 window asks for backing store to be used, and
some windows managers may use it to handle repaints, but it seems that
most repainting is done by replaying the display list (and here the fast
drawing is very helpful).

   <p>There are perennial problems with finding fonts.  Many users fail to
realize that fonts are a function of the X server and not of the machine
that R is running on.  After many difficulties, R tries first to
find the nearest size match in the sizes provided for Adobe fonts in the
standard 75dpi and 100dpi X11 font packages&mdash;even that will fail to
work when users of near-100dpi screens have only the 75dpi set
installed.  The 75dpi set allows sizes down to 6 points on a 100dpi
screen, but some users do try to use smaller sizes and even 6 and 8
point bitmapped fonts do not look good.

   <p>Introduction of UTF-8 locales has caused another wave of difficulties. 
X11 has very few genuine UTF-8 fonts, and produces composite fontsets
for the <code>iso10646-1</code> encoding.  Unfortunately these seem to have
low coverage apart from a few monospaced fonts in a few sizes (which are
not suitable for graph annotation), and where glyphs are missing what is
plotted is often quite unsatisfactory.

   <p>The approach being taken as from R 2.7.0 is to make use of more modern
toolkits, namely <code>cairo</code> for rendering and <code>Pango</code> for font
management&mdash;because these are associated with <code>Gtk+2</code> they are
widely available.  Cairo supports translucent colours and alpha-blending
(<em>via</em> <code>Xrender</code>), and anti-aliasing for the display of lines
and text.  Pango's font management is based on <code>fontconfig</code> and
somewhat mysterious, but it seems mainly to use Type 1 and TrueType
fonts on the machine running R and send grayscale bitmaps to cairo.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.7.2 windows()</h5>

<p>The <code>windows()</code> device is a family of devices: it supports plotting
to Windows (enhanced) metafiles, <code>BMP</code>, <code>JPEG</code>, <code>PNG</code> and
<code>TIFF</code> files as well as to Windows printers.

   <p>In most of these cases the primary plotting is to a bitmap: this is used
for the (default) buffering of the screen device, which also enables the
current plot to be saved to BMP, JPEG, PNG or TIFF (it is the internal
bitmap which is copied to the file in the appropriate format).

   <p>The device units are pixels (logical ones on a metafile device).

   <p>The code was originally written by Guido Masarotto with extensive use of
macros, which can make it hard to disentangle.

   <p>For a screen device, <code>xd-&gt;gawin</code> is the canvas of the screen, and
<code>xd-&gt;bm</code> is the off-screen bitmap.  So macro <code>DRAW</code> arranges
to plot to <code>xd-&gt;bm</code>, and if buffering is off, also to
<code>xd-&gt;gawin</code>.  For all other device, <code>xd-&gt;gawin</code> is the canvas,
a bitmap for the <code>jpeg()</code> and <code>png()</code> device, and an internal
representation of a Windows metafile for the <code>win.metafile()</code> and
<code>win.print</code> device.  Since ‘plotting’ is done by Windows GDI calls
to the appropriate canvas, its precise nature is hidden by the GDI
system.

   <p>Buffering on the screen device is achieved by running a timer, which
when it fires copies the internal bitmap to the screen.  This is set to
fire every 500ms (by default) and is reset to 100ms after plotting
activity.

   <p>Repaint events are handled by copying the internal bitmap to the screen
canvas (and then reinitializing the timer), unless there has been a resize. 
Resizes are handled by replaying the display list: this might not be
necessary if a fixed canvas with scrollbars is being used, but that is
the least popular of the three forms of resizing.

   <p>Text on the device has moved to ‘Unicode’ (UCS-2) in recent years.  As
from  R 2.7.0, UTF-8 is requested (<code>hasTextUTF8 = TRUE</code>) for
standard text, and converted to UCS-2 in the plotting functions in file
<samp><span class="file">src/extra/graphapp/gdraw.c</span></samp>.  However, GDI has no support for
Unicode symbol fonts, and symbols are handled in Adobe Symbol encoding.

   <p>Support for translucent colours (with alpha channel between 0 and 255)
was introduced in R 2.6.0 for the screen device only, and extended to
the bitmap devices in R 2.7.0.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-20" name="fnd-20"><sup>20</sup></a> This is done by drawing on a further
internal bitmap, <code>xd-&gt;bm2</code>, in the opaque version of the colour
then alpha-blending that bitmap to <code>xd-&gt;bm</code>.  The alpha-blending
routine is in a separate DLL, <samp><span class="file">msimg32.dll</span></samp>, which is loaded on
first use.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-21" name="fnd-21"><sup>21</sup></a>  As small a rectangular region as
reasonably possible is alpha-blended (this is rectangle <code>r</code> in the
code), but things like mitre joins make estimation of a tight bounding
box too much work for lines and polygonal boundaries. 
Translucent-coloured lines are not common, and the performance seems
acceptable.

   <p>The support for a transparent background in <code>png()</code> predates full
alpha-channel support in <code>libpng</code> (let alone in PNG viewers), so
makes use of the limited transparency support in earlier versions of
PNG.  Where 24-bit colour is used, this is done by marking a single
colour to be rendered as transparent.  R chose ‘<samp><span class="samp">#fdfefd</span></samp>’, and
uses this as the background colour (in <code>GA_NewPage</code> if the
specified background colour is transparent (and all non-opaque
background colours are treated as transparent).  So this works by
marking that colour in the PNG file, and viewers without transparency
support see a slightly-off-white background, as if there were a
near-white canvas.  Where a palette is used in the PNG file (if less
than 256 colours were used) then this colour is recorded with full
transparency and the remaining colours as opaque.  If 32-bit colour were
available then we could add a full alpha channel, but this is dependent
on the graphics hardware and undocumented properties of GDI.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Colours</h3>

<p>Devices receive colours as an <code>unsigned int</code> (in the <code>GPar</code>
structure and some of the devices as the <code>typedef</code> <code>rcolor</code>):
the comments in file <samp><span class="file">R_ext/GraphicsDevice.h</span></samp> are the primary
documentation.  The 4 bytes in the <code>unsigned int</code> are
<em>R</em>,<em>G</em>,<em>B</em> and <em>alpha</em> from least to most
significant. So each of RGB has 256 levels of luminosity from 0 to 255. 
The alpha byte represents (from R 2.0.0) opacity, so value 255 is
fully opaque and 0 fully transparent: many but not all devices handle
semi-transparent colours.

   <p>Colors can be created in C via the macro <code>R_RGBA</code>, and a set of
macros are defined in <samp><span class="file">R_ext/GraphicsDevice.h</span></samp> to extract the
various components.

   <p>Colours in the base graphics system were originally adopted from S (and
before that the GRZ library from Bell Labs), with the concept of a
(variable-sized) palette of colours referenced by numbers
‘<samp><span class="samp">1...</span><var>N</var></samp>’ plus ‘<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>’ (the background colour of the current
device).  R introduced the idea of referring to colours by character
strings, either in the forms ‘<samp><span class="samp">#RRGGBB</span></samp>’ or ‘<samp><span class="samp">#RRGGBBAA</span></samp>’
(representing the bytes in hex) as given by function <code>rgb()</code> or via
names: the 657 known names are given in the character vector
<code>colors</code> and in a table in file <samp><span class="file">colors.c</span></samp>.  Note that
semi-transparent colours are not ‘premultiplied’, so 50% transparent
white is ‘<samp><span class="samp">#ffffff80</span></samp>’.

   <p>The handling of negative colour numbers is undefined (and inconsistent):
they will in future be made an error.  Colours greater than
‘<samp><var>N</var></samp>’ are wrapped around, so that for example with the default
palette of size 8, colour ‘<samp><span class="samp">10</span></samp>’ is colour ‘<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>’ in the palette.

   <p>Integer colours have been used more widely than the base graphics
sub-system, as they are supported by package <strong>grid</strong> and hence by
<strong>lattice</strong> and <strong>ggplot2</strong>.  (They are also used by package
<strong>rgl</strong>.)  <strong>grid</strong> re-defines colour ‘<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>’ to be transparent
white, but <strong>rgl</strong> uses <code>col2rgb</code> and hence the background colour
of base graphics.

   <p>Note that positive integer colours refer to the current palette (which
is per-session, not per-device) and colour ‘<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>’ to the current
device (and a device is opened if needs be).  These are mapped to type
<code>rcolor</code> at the time of use: this matters when re-playing the
display list, e.g. when a device is resized or <code>dev.copy</code> is
used.

   <p>What was for a long time unclear was how the RGB values were to be
mapped to display colours in the graphics device.  R 2.13.0 adopted
the colorspace ‘sRGB’. This is an industry standard: it is used by Web
browsers and JPEGs from all but high-end digital cameras.  The
interpretation is a matter for graphics devices and for code that
manipulates colours, but not for the graphics engine or subsystems.

   <p>R uses a painting model similar to PostScript and PDF.  This means
that where shapes (circles, rectangles and polygons) can both be filled
and have a stroked border, the fill should be painted first and then the
border (or otherwise only half the border will be visible).  Where both
the fill and the border are semi-transparent there is some room for
interpretation of the intention.  Most devices first paint the fill and
then the border, alpha-blending at each step.  However, PDF does some
automatic grouping of objects, and <em>when the fill and the border
have the same alpha</em>, they are painted onto the same layer and then
alpha-blended in one step.  (See p. 569 of the PDF Reference Sixth
Edition, version 1.7.  Unfortunately, although this is what the PDF
standard says should happen, it is not correctly implemented by some
viewers.)

<h3 class="section">6.3 Base graphics</h3>

<p>The base graphics system will move to package <strong>graphics</strong> in R
3.0.0, but is currently implemented in files in <samp><span class="file">src/main</span></samp>.

   <p>For historical reasons it is largely implemented in two layers. 
Files <samp><span class="file">plot.c</span></samp>, <code>plot3d.c</code> and <code>par.c</code> contain the code
for the around 30 <code>.Internal</code> calls that implement the basic
graphics operations.  This code then calls functions with names starting
with <code>G</code> and declared in header <samp><span class="file">Rgraphics.h</span></samp> in file
<samp><span class="file">graphics.c</span></samp>, which in turn call the graphics engine (whose
functions almost all have names starting with <code>GE</code>).

   <p>A large part of the infrastructure of the base graphics subsystem are
the graphics parameters (as set/read by <code>par()</code>).  These are stored
in a <code>GPar</code> structure declared in the private header
<samp><span class="file">Graphics.h</span></samp>.  This structure has two variables (<code>state</code> and
<code>valid</code>) tracking the state of the base subsystem on the device,
and many variables recording the graphics parameters and functions of
them.

   <p>The base system state is contained in <code>baseSystemState</code> structure
defined in <samp><span class="file">R_ext/GraphicsBase.h</span></samp>.  This contains three <code>GPar</code>
structures and a Boolean variable used to record if <code>plot.new()</code>
(or <code>persp</code>) has been used successfully on the device.

   <p>The three copies of the <code>GPar</code> structure are used to store the
current parameters (accessed via <code>gpptr</code>), the ‘device copy’
(accessed via <code>dpptr</code>) and space for a saved copy of the `device
copy' parameters.  The current parameters are, clearly, those currently
in use and are copied from the ‘device copy’ whenever <code>plot.new()</code>
is called (whether or not that advances to the next ‘page’). The saved
copy keeps the state when the device was last completely cleared (e.g. 
when <code>plot.new()</code> was called with <code>par(new=TRUE)</code>), and is
used to replay the display list.

   <p>The separation is not completely clean: the ‘device copy’ is altered if
a plot with log scale(s) is set up via <code>plot.window()</code>.

   <p>There is yet another copy of most of the graphics parameters in
<code>static</code> variables in <samp><span class="file">graphics.c</span></samp> which are used to preserve
the current parameters across the processing of inline parameters in
high-level graphics calls (handled by <code>ProcessInlinePars</code>).

   <p>Snapshots of the base subsystem record the ‘saved device copy’ of the
<code>GPar</code> structure.

   <p>There remain quite a number of anomalies.  For example, function
<code>GEcontourLines</code> is (despite its name) coded in file
<samp><span class="file">plot3d.c</span></samp> and used to support function <code>contourLines</code> in
package <strong>grDevices</strong>.

<h2 class="chapter">8 R coding standards</h2>

<p><a name="index-coding-standards-157"></a>R is meant to run on a wide variety of platforms, including Linux and
most variants of Unix as well as Windows and Mac OS X. 
Therefore, when extending R by either adding to the R base
distribution or by providing an add-on package, one should not rely on
features specific to only a few supported platforms, if this can be
avoided.  In particular, although most R developers use <acronym>GNU</acronym>
tools, they should not employ the <acronym>GNU</acronym> extensions to standard
tools.  Whereas some other software packages explicitly rely on e.g. 
<acronym>GNU</acronym> make or the <acronym>GNU</acronym> C++ compiler, R does not. 
Nevertheless, R is a <acronym>GNU</acronym> project, and the spirit of the
<cite><acronym>GNU</acronym> Coding Standards</cite> should be followed if possible.

   <p>The following tools can &ldquo;safely be assumed&rdquo; for R extensions.

     <ul>
<li>An ISO C99 C compiler.  Note that extensions such as <acronym>POSIX</acronym>
1003.1 must be tested for, typically using Autoconf unless you are sure
they are supported on all mainstream R platforms (including Windows
and Mac OS X).  Packages will be more portable to R &lt; 2.12.0 if
written assuming only C89, but this should not be done where using C99
features will make for cleaner or more robust code.

     <li>A FORTRAN 77 compiler (but not Fortran 9x).

     <li>A simple <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, considering the features of <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> in
4.2 <acronym>BSD</acronym> systems as a baseline. 
<a name="index-make-158"></a>
<acronym>GNU</acronym> or other extensions, including pattern rules using
‘<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>’, the automatic variable ‘<samp><span class="samp">$^</span></samp>’, the ‘<samp><span class="samp">+=</span></samp>’ syntax to
append to the value of a variable, the (&ldquo;safe&rdquo;) inclusion of makefiles
with no error, conditional execution, and many more, must not be used
(see Chapter &ldquo;Features&rdquo; in the <cite><acronym>GNU</acronym> Make Manual</cite> for
more information).  On the other hand, building R in a separate
directory (not containing the sources) should work provided that
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> supports the <code>VPATH</code> mechanism.

     <p>Windows-specific makefiles can assume <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> 3.79
or later, as no other <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> is viable on that platform.

     <li>A Bourne shell and the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Unix programming tools, including
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.

     <p>There are <acronym>POSIX</acronym> standards for these tools, but these may not
be fully supported.  Baseline features could be determined from a book
such as <cite>The UNIX Programming Environment</cite> by Brian W. Kernighan &amp;
Rob Pike.  Note in particular that ‘<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>’ in a regexp is an extended
regexp, and is not supported by all versions of <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>.  The Open Group Base Specifications, Issue 7, which are
technically identical to  IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX), 2008,
are available at
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/mindex.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/mindex.html</a>. 
</ul>

   <p>Under Windows, most users will not have these tools installed, and you
should not require their presence for the operation of your package. 
However, users who install your package from source will have them, as
they can be assumed to have followed the instructions in &ldquo;the Windows
toolset&rdquo; appendix of the &ldquo;R Installation and Administration&rdquo; manual
to obtain them.  Redirection cannot be assumed to be available via
<samp><span class="command">system</span></samp> as this does not use a standard shell (let alone a
Bourne shell).

<p class="noindent">In addition, the following tools are needed for certain tasks.

     <ul>
<li>Perl version 5 is only needed for a few uncommonly-used tools: <samp><span class="command">make
install-info</span></samp> needs Perl installed if there is no command
<samp><span class="command">install-info</span></samp> on the system, and for the maintainer-only script
<samp><span class="file">tools/help2man.pl</span></samp>. 
<a name="index-Perl-159"></a>
<li>Makeinfo version 4.7 or later is needed to build the Info files for the
R manuals written in the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Texinfo system. 
<a name="index-makeinfo-160"></a></ul>

   <p>It is also important that code is written in a way that allows others to
understand it.  This is particularly helpful for fixing problems, and
includes using self-descriptive variable names, commenting the code, and
also formatting it properly.  The R Core Team recommends to use a
basic indentation of 4 for R and C (and most likely also Perl) code,
and 2 for documentation in Rd format.  Emacs (21 or later) users can
implement this indentation style by putting the following in one of
their startup files, and using customization to set the
<code>c-default-style</code> to <code>"bsd"</code> and <code>c-basic-offset</code> to
<code>4</code>.)

<p>When you (as R developer) add new functions to the R base (all the
packages distributed with R), be careful to check if <kbd>make
test-Specific</kbd> or particularly, <kbd>cd tests; make no-segfault.Rout</kbd>
still works (without interactive user intervention, and on a standalone
computer).  If the new function, for example, accesses the Internet, or
requires <acronym>GUI</acronym> interaction, please add its name to the &ldquo;stop
list&rdquo; in <samp><span class="file">tests/no-segfault.Rin</span></samp>.

   <p>[To be revised: use <samp><span class="command">make check-devel</span></samp>, check the write barrier
if you change internal structures.]

<h2 class="chapter">10 Use of TeX dialects</h2>

<p>Various dialects of TeX and used for different purposes in R.  The
policy is that manuals be written in ‘<samp><span class="samp">texinfo</span></samp>’, and for convenience
the main and Windows FAQs are also.  This has the advantage that is is
easy to produce HTML and plain text versions as well as typeset manuals.

   <p>LaTeX is not used directly, but rather as an intermediate format for
typeset help documents and for vignettes.

   <p>Care needs to be taken about the assumptions made about the R user's
system: it may not have either ‘<samp><span class="samp">texinfo</span></samp>’ or a TeX system
installed.  We have attempted to abstract out the cross-platform
differences, and almost all the setting of typeset documents is done by
<code>tools::texi2dvi</code>.  This is used for offline printing of help
documents, preparing vignettes and for package manuals via <samp><span class="command">R
CMD Rd2pdf</span></samp>.  It is not currently used for the R manuals created in
directory <samp><span class="file">doc/manual</span></samp>.

   <p><code>tools::texi2dvi</code> makes use of a system command <samp><span class="command">texi2dvi</span></samp>
where available.  On a Unix-alike this is usually part of
‘<samp><span class="samp">texinfo</span></samp>’, whereas on Windows if it exists at all it would be an
executable, part of MiKTeX.  If none is available, the R code runs
a sequence of <samp><span class="command">(pdf)latex</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">bibtex</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">makeindex</span></samp> commands.

   <p>This process has been rather vulnerable to the versions of the external
software used: particular issues have been <samp><span class="command">texi2dvi</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp> updates, mismatches between the two<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-24" name="fnd-24"><sup>24</sup></a>,
versions of the LaTeX package ‘<samp><span class="samp">hyperref</span></samp>’ and quirks in index
production.  The licenses used for LaTeX and latterly ‘<samp><span class="samp">texinfo</span></samp>’
prohibit us from including ‘known good’ versions in the R distribution.

   <p>On a Unix-alike <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> looks for the executables for TeX and
friends and if found records the absolute paths in the system
<samp><span class="file">Renviron</span></samp> file.  This used to record ‘<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>’ if no command
was found, but it nowadays records the name for looking up on the path
at run time.  The latter can be important for binary distributions: one
does not want to be tied to, for example, TeXLive 2007.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> strictly, a <code>SEXPREC</code>
node; <code>VECTOR_SEXPREC</code> nodes are slightly smaller but followed by
data in the node.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> a pointer to a function or a symbol to look up the
function by name, or a language object to be evaluated to give a
function.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> This is almost unused.  The only
current use is for hash tables of environments (<code>VECSXP</code>s), where
<code>length</code> is the size of the table and <code>truelength</code> is the
number of primary slots in use, and for the reference hash tables in
serialization (<code>VECSXP</code>s), where <code>truelength</code> is the number of
slots in use.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> Remember that attaching a list or
a saved image actually creates and populates an environment and attaches
that.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> There is currently one other
difference: when profiling builtin functions are counted as function
calls but specials are not.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-6" href="#fnd-6">6</a>]</small> the other current example
is left brace, which is implemented as a primitive.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-7" href="#fnd-7">7</a>]</small> only bits 0:4 are currently used
for <code>SEXPTYPE</code>s but values 241:255 are used for
pseudo-<code>SEXPTYPE</code>s.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-8" href="#fnd-8">8</a>]</small> Currently the only relevant bits are 0:1, 4, 14:15.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-9" href="#fnd-9">9</a>]</small> See define
<code>USE_UTF8_IF_POSSIBLE</code> in file <samp><span class="file">src/main/gram.c</span></samp>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-10" href="#fnd-10">10</a>]</small> or UTF-16 if support for surrogates is enabled in the OS,
which it is not normally so at least for Western versions of Windows,
despite some claims to the contrary on the Microsoft website.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-11" href="#fnd-11">11</a>]</small> but not the
GraphApp toolkit.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-12" href="#fnd-12">12</a>]</small> This can also create
non-S4 objects, as in <code>new("integer")</code>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-13" href="#fnd-13">13</a>]</small> although this is
not recommended as it is less future-proof.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-14" href="#fnd-14">14</a>]</small> but apparently not on Windows.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-15" href="#fnd-15">15</a>]</small> The C code is in files <code>base.c</code>,
<code>graphics.c</code>, <code>par.c</code>, <code>plot.c</code> and <code>plot3d.c</code> in
directory <samp><span class="file">src/main</span></samp>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-16" href="#fnd-16">16</a>]</small> although that needs to be
handled carefully, as for example the <code>xspline</code> functions used
prior to R 2.7.0 to depend on the aspect ratio of the pixels, and the
<code>circle</code> callback is given a radius (and that should be interpreted
as in the x units).</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-17" href="#fnd-17">17</a>]</small> It is
possible for the device to find the <code>GEDevDesc</code> which points to its
<code>DevDesc</code>, and this is done often enough that there is a
convenience function <code>desc2GEDesc</code> to do so.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-18" href="#fnd-18">18</a>]</small> Calling
<code>R_CheckDeviceAvailable()</code> ensures there is a free slot or throws
an error.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-19" href="#fnd-19">19</a>]</small> in device coordinates</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-20" href="#fnd-20">20</a>]</small> It is technically possible to
use alpha-blending on metafile devices such as printers, but it seems
few drivers have support for this.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-21" href="#fnd-21">21</a>]</small> It is available on Windows 2000 or later, and so had
to be optional in R 2.6.0.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-22" href="#fnd-22">22</a>]</small> under Windows, junction points, or copies if
environment variable <samp><span class="env">R_WIN_NO_JUNCTIONS</span></samp> has a non-empty value.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-23" href="#fnd-23">23</a>]</small> see the previous footnote.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-24" href="#fnd-24">24</a>]</small> Linux
distributions tend to unbundle <samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp> from ‘<samp><span class="samp">texinfo</span></samp>’.</p>
